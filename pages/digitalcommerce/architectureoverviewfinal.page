It is impossible to scale a development team and delegate responsibility for development of features.&nbsp;Ultimately,&nbsp; it turns into the uncontrollable constant growth of your technical department.</p>\n\n<p>SaaS (Software as a Service) is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted by provider. This approach is perfect for small businesses with simple business models, but doesn&rsquo;t allow any growth to change the business model. It is impossible to change the solution according to specific&nbsp;business needs, challenging to implement your&nbsp;scenarios, control performance, continuity, and security.</p>\n\n<p>Closed software products are&nbsp;software where only the original authors of software can access and alter the software&#39;s code. In this case all innovations are totally dependent on vendor roadmaps. In this instance, it is much harder to innovate, as the vendor is more interested in delivering uniform functionality required for thousands of&nbsp;customers, rather than the innovative technologies only a few of their clients require. It&#39;s also important to note that it is challenging&nbsp;to find experienced people who are narrow specialists in one particular type of closed software.</p>\n",
