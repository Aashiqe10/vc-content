### <dfn>The new Stripe Checkout payment module will let you integrate your Virto Commerce based online store with Stripe allowing to accept all sorts of payments, including Bitcoins.</dfn>

We have released the new *Stripe Checkout payment module* that will allow you to integrate your <a href="{{ 'https://virtocommerce.com/b2b-ecommerce-platform' | absolute_url }}">Virto Commerce</a> based online store with the [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) payment API.

This sets the new standard in online payments! Stripe is the leading payment solution for running an internet business that handles billions of dollars every year for forward-thinking businesses around the world. And now its full functionality is available for the Virto Commerce users, allowing them to conveniently accept payments and pay out to third parties.

The new module will allow you to take advantage of the advanced Stripe functionality, including customizing onboarding, setting payout timing, supporting complex money movement, and potential integration with financial reporting. 

It will let you track balances automatically, merge earnings and convert them into payouts, set up timed transfers and payouts for your users, and retry failed transfers. It also allows for incorporation of advanced flows, such as Account Debits, one-to-many payments, and others; and offers the option of Instant Payouts.
