# “Or” based filters

The filtering has been improved. Now it is possible to filter items using multiple facets of the same kind. For example products can be filtered by brand “samsung” or “sony”. Also the new filter was introduced for subcategories. It will automatically show all direct child subcategories for current category.

# Clear Cache through admin

The cache can be now cleared from Commerce Manager. There are two types of cache that can be cleared: html output cache (all rendered pages, sitemap) and database cache (objects retrieved from database). The cache can be selectively cleared for specific areas or all cache.

# Sitemap improvements

There were some issues fixed related to sitemap. Also top menu categories are now created dynamically from database for current store and can be ordered using priority of categories.

# Paypal improvements

There were fixes and improvements done to paypal express checkout. Now checkout will create order in database before redirecting to paypal payment site. When paypal redirects back it sends token that was saved in order payment. This allows finding correct order and continue checkout process.

# More discount related fields added to order module

<span class="code-block">
`AddColumn(“dbo.OrderForm”, “LineItemDiscountAmount”, c => c.Decimal(nullable: false, precision: 18, scale: 2));
AddColumn(“dbo.OrderForm”, “ShipmentDiscountAmount”, c => c.Decimal(nullable: false, precision: 18, scale: 2));
AddColumn(“dbo.OrderGroup”, “DiscountTotal”, c => c.Decimal(nullable: false, precision: 18, scale: 2));
AddColumn(“dbo.OrderGroup”, “FormDiscountTotal”, c => c.Decimal(nullable: false, precision: 18, scale: 2));
AddColumn(“dbo.OrderGroup”, “LineItemDiscountTotal”, c => c.Decimal(nullable: false, precision: 18, scale: 2));
AddColumn(“dbo.OrderGroup”, “ShipmentDiscountTotal”, c => c.Decimal(nullable: false, precision: 18, scale: 2));`
</span>

This allows more precisely store, identify and display orders when needed.

# Design improvements

The mobile design has been improved. Now in mobile menu there are links to login, view cart and wish list.
