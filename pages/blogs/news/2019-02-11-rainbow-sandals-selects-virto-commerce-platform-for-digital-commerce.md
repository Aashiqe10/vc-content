    Los Angeles, Ca. (Newswire) - February 2019 - Virto Commerce, a leading provider of digital commerce
    software, today announced that Rainbow® Sandals selected the Virto Commerce digital platform to
    transform its B2B and B2C commerce solutions.

    Rainbow® Sandals are created by hand, using specially formulated glue to keep the layers together and the
    straps in place and prevent breakage. The Rainbow® founder personally formulated the various densities
    of sponge rubber with "memory" to mold to individuals' feet. The reputation of making quality and
    comfortable sandals is how Rainbow® has grown to be the popular sandal they are today.

    "We are pleased to be working with the Virto Commerce team to improve our commerce solution," said
    Jay "Sparky" Longley, Founder and CEO of Rainbow® Sandals. "We look forward to the improved online store
