Hi guys!

We are really exited today.

We decided to celebrate the 1st of July by releasing Virto Commerce SDK.

Now anyone can download and install a fully operational webstore in about 15 minutes.

All you need is a machine running MS Windows 7|8 with MS SQL Server 2008|2012

After installation you'll have a front-end, database with demo data and administration back-end.

You can get both x86 and x64 versions of SDK here [https://virtocommerce.com/download-sdk](https://virtocommerce.com/download-sdk).

We highly appreciate your feedback and welcome any comments and suggestions you have on how we can continue to improve Virto Commerce.

If you encounter any issues during installation or need our help just let us know by sending a message to support@virtocommerce.com
  
Have a nice experience!
