Both customers and merchants want to be sure that their data is secure. So web stores must establish practices that minimize fraud risk. Why is fraud protection especially important for eCommerce sites? The answer is obvious because they collect highly sensitive customer data like email, credit card details and a physical address.

Payment and bank details of large organizations and individuals mustn't get into the wrong hands! If you agree with this, please read on and get to know what actions an eCommerce store can take to increase customers' safety and protect the store from frauds.

<i>The key ones include:</i>

•	First of all, you need to choose a <strong>safe eCommerce platform</strong>. We will help you with that as you will find some Magento, OpenCart, PrestaShop, and Shopify templates developed by <a href="https://www.templatemonster.com/?aff=virtocommerce&utm_campaign=blog_site_virtocommerce&utm_source=10.01.2017_guestpost&utm_medium=fraud" rel="nofollow">TemplateMonser</a> for the fastest and the safest start at the end of this blog post.

•	<strong>Set up alerts</strong>. You can set up an alert system detecting suspicious activity originating from a single IP address or from a single account (like multiple disparate transactions that use different credit cards or are destined for varied shipping locations.

•	<strong>Use IP proxy and geo-location identification services</strong>. If you suspect that an IP address may be a proxy server or comes from an area you don't provide your services to, you can use proxy identification and geo-location services to confirm or refute your distrust. You can also involve an Address Verification System (AVS) to aid this.

•	Take <strong>PCI DSS compliance</strong> serious. The point is that Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliant stores are proactively protecting customer data. We are sure that you want to be among them.

•	Get the <strong>security certifications</strong>. You have probably seen sites with SSL certification. They show ‘https’ in the URL instead of ‘http’. Follow this good practice, get your site similarly certified. Moreover, you can go even further trying to get the greater level of certification EV SSL, which shows the green bar beside the URL in addition to using ‘https’.

•	<strong>Get rid of useless sensitive data</strong>. All websites tend to compile information about their users but with eCommerce sites, this usually includes the customers’ financial information like bank and credit card verification details. When you store these details for longer than is required, you create an information bank that looks very tempting to scammers. What is a reasonable amount of time to store such information? It's the period in which they can return their purchase, or if they participate in a competition until the results are announced.

•	<strong>Track every order</strong>. Take good care of your customers by tracking every order. This way you will be able to identify and fight chargeback frauds.

What's more, eCommerce projects need to constantly educate both their employees and customers. <strong>Train your employees</strong> on best security practices and invest in a fraud management service.

<i>As to the customer education, you can try the following:</i>

•	Make them use <strong>strong passwords</strong>. By forcing customers meet password setting criteria and informing them of its necessity, eCommerce stores can ensure that it is harder for hackers to guess passwords during their violent attacks.

•	<strong>URL checking</strong>. By instructing customers that they should always check for the SSL/EV SSL certification of the site they visit, you can be sure that they never land on a fake duplicate page.

•	Using <strong>verification systems</strong>. Teach the customer to make use of CAPTCHA, which is two-step verification, and other similar security verification methods when making a transaction to avoid issues with frauds.
