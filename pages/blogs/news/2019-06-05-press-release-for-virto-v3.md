    What's New with Virto Commerce Version 3
</p>
<ul class="text" style="margin-left:25px;word-break:break-word;">
    <li>
        Platform Compatible: ASP.NET Core is cross-platform – which means Virto Commerce can run on macOS, Linux and Windows.
    </li>
    <li>
        Performance: Improved performance of ASP.NET Core together with some architectural changes lead to significant improvement of the platform performance.
    </li>
    <li>
        Containers: Migrating to ASP.NET Core enables next steps on platform containerization (a platform becomes Docker ready), automating application deployment, scaling and
        management (Kubernetes).
    </li>
    <li>
        Extensible: Architecture changes lead to extensibility improvements, and that means that the development of features will be cheaper for clients and partner solution
        development.
    </li>
</ul>
