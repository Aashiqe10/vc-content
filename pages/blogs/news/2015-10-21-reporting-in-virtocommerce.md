The amount of data accumulated for analysis is increasing daily. In the past, companies used internal data sources for analysis and decision-making. Usually SQL database server was used as the default data source. Today a common enterprise company having multiple subsystems can have different data sources like Microsoft Sql Server, Oracle Sql Server, SAP, structured files (XML, XLS, CSV etc.) and many more to store and exchange data.

A great volume of analytical data is placed in external &amp; cloud based sources such as Google Analytics, Google BigQuery, ZenDesk, Salesforce Objects etc.

Company analysts face a difficult task to aggregate data from different sources and use it for analytical reports. Recently, these duties were performed by company IT departments, because analysts and consumers are not skilled enough to retrieve the data and build the report.

Since the advent of Business Intelligent platforms, IT mediation has become optional. BI platforms offer a large number of connectors to connect with different data sources. A user can connect to a data source within minutes and start using visual tools to retrieve and analyze data, even without special IT qualifications. There are many BI platforms on the market already. Solutions such as these are in high demand and we expect the number of BI solutions to grow.

That is why in VirtoCommerce we decided to let the BI systems analyze data, compose charts and build reports based on the rules and requirements of the end user.

Included in our documentation we have written overviews for two leading BI systems (according to <a class="external-link" href="https://www.microstrategy.com/us/go/gartner-magic-quadrant-16" rel="nofollow">The Gartner Magic Quadrant</a>). The goal of the documents is not to build a complete analysis of VirtoCommerce data. The goal is to demonstrate how easy it is to create charts, reports and analyze accumulated data using BI platform and VirtoCommerce accumulated data.
