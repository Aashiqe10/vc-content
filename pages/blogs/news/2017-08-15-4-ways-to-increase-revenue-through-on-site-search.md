### <dfn>Four Ways to Increase Revenue Through On-Site Search</dfn>

With the eCommerce world becoming increasingly saturated, retailers must make sure that their online stores exceed consumers’ expectations. An online store needs to be simple and easy to navigate for shoppers to successfully check out, and return for further purchases. If your eCommerce store fails to be functional and efficient, visitors will leave frustrated and turn to your competition who can provide them with the service they expect. Below are four major on-site search tips that can enhance your store’s user experience and maximize revenue. 

<h2>AUTOCOMPLETE</h2>

With engines like Google search, it’s no surprise that autocomplete has become a norm in the eCommerce world. If your <a href="{{ 'https://virtocommerce.com/glossary/b2b-ecommerce-companies-websites' | absolute_url }}">site</a> does not have an effective autocomplete, you are living in the past. Ultimately, autocomplete simplifies the search experience for consumers by allowing visitors to find a specific product without having to type in an entire word into the search bar. This function not only leaves customers satisfied, but also leads to increased conversions and overall sales. 

Ensure that you are taking advantage of the robust autocomplete tools out there. These tools allow informative content such as blogs, videos, and photos to be included in the search results along with relevant products. 

For example, Kraft Heinz uses the enhanced autocomplete function to show popular searches and recipes based off of the word that is typed into the search bar.

<h2>FILTERS</h2>

Filters are an excellent way for consumers to shop quickly and efficiently. Filters help prevent consumers from becoming overwhelmed by thousands of products on one page, by filtering the results down to a specific <a href="{{ 'https://virtocommerce.com/product-information-management-software' | absolute_url }}">product</a> they are looking for. They can get very specific, narrowing down to style, size, manufacturer, designer, color, etc. Without filters, it is almost as if the consumer has to sift through thousands of racks in stores to just find one specific item they are looking for, which is a process that results in frustration.

<strong>Tip</strong>: Make sure that your filters relate to the category page that they are displayed on. For example, you don’t want to display a shoe size filter on a jacket category page because it’s irrelevant. Rather, use filters such as pattern, style, and length for jackets. There are [tools](http://www.nextopia.com/solutions/website-navigation) out there that allow for fully customizable dynamic filtering on any page.

<h2>REDIRECTS</h2>

One of the worst things a retailer can do is directing a consumer to a “No Results Found” page.  This will automatically inform the consumer that your website does not carry the product. In reality, your store may in fact carry the product but call the product something else, or the consumer may have misspelled it. Either way, a site should redirect consumers to another product page with <a href="{{ '/glossary/product-recommendation-engine' | absolute_url }}"> similar products</a> to the one they searched for, or to an informative page that prompts the visitor to continue shopping and make another search. 

<h2>AN INVITING SEARCH BAR</h2>

Discussing ways to increase revenue through site search is irrelevant without an effective and well placed search bar. If a visitor cannot find the search bar, then this should be the first problem addressed and solved. 

This is especially important since 97% of all visitors looking for a specific product go straight to the search bar. Ensure your search bar is easy to find – front and center – and appears on every page for consumers that know exactly what they’re looking for.
