Platform export/import functionality frequently can be used for the following cases:

* Update data from “staging” to “production”
* Backup tasks
* Distribute predefined environments (example: apparel stores template, digital store etc.)
* Client environment troubleshooting (client can send to us system backup)

# Dynamic properties

Now the platform allows to add new properties to entities at runtime.

In the main menu click **Settings** then in the toolbar click **Dynamic properties**, select the entity type from the list and click **Add** in the toolbar.

Enter the property name and select one of the supported value types:

* Short text
* Long text
* Integer
* Decimal
* Date/Time
* Boolean

There are a number of options which modify the behavior of the property:

* Required
* Multivalue
* Multilingual
* Dictionary

Also you can define the property name for each of the registered languages and for multilingual properties you can enter different values for each language when editing an object.

After the property is added to the entity type it will be available for entering a value for every object of this type.

# Avalara AvaTax integration module improved

![](assets/images/blog/logo-tagline-extend-FF6600-@2x.png)

During this sprint we improved the AvaTax module to get certified by Avalara.

What’s been added and improved in the module:

* “Tax type” property added to product, shipment. That way products and shipments can get tax codes. It’s a dynamic dictionary, so missing tax codes can be added dynamically

* Address validation in customer address blade added. Address validation is more like a check if address is valid, though address still can be saved even not valid by Avalara service.

![](assets/images/blog/vcscreenshotv2-3-8validatelogo.png)

* Address validation can be disabled or enabled from settings.

* Partial returns of order initiates tax recalculation, so “Return invoice” of items returned generated in Avalara.
* Order cancellation initiates tax document void in Avalara.
* Logs added and improved.
* Tax configuration and setup documentation added - [link](http://docs.virtocommerce.com/x/8gHr).

# ShipStation integration module
