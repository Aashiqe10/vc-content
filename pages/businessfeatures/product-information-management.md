                <h2>What is product information management? Product information management software meaning.</h2>
                <p class="text"><strong>Product Information Management Software (PIM)</strong> is a solution that is used to market and sell various types of products via distribution channels. Product information management tools coordinate changing product information across all channels of communication, thus ensuring that a business’s entire ecosystem has consistent and up-to-date information. Wikipedia offers the following definition: “Product information management or PIM refers to processes and technologies focused on centrally managing information about products, with a focus on the data required to market and sell the products through one or more distribution channels”. </p>
                </div>
        </div>
            <p class="text">Without a centralized location for storing data, companies rely on tedious and time-consuming spreadsheet-based manual data management as their product information management solutions, which makes it virtually impossible to satisfy the increasing demands of ecommerce markets. </p>
            <p class="text">Product information management systems offer the concept of entering and storing the product information once in a single place. This place is the source from which that information is then distributed without needing to be re-entered manually into a number of different systems. There is no need to spread all across your data, as you can easily manage, consolidate and improve media websites, ERP systems, print catalogs, and data feeds by implementing useful product information management tools. Therefore, if your goal is to find a product information management system that is centralized, offers independent data maintenance and collection product information, management capabilities are the right fit for you!</p>

    <h2>Reasons for product information management solutions growth</h2>
    <p class="text">Product information management tools are mostly used to keep customers, stakeholders, and partners informed about all the updates in product related information. After products and services are created and added to the catalog, the status of materials, equipment, suppliers, distributors, etc. can change, often multiple times. Product information management system will note these changes and communicate promptly to maximize efficiency and minimize the impact of changes on the sales cycle. Product information management software allows for faster time to market, increases operational efficiency, and promotes sales growth. </p>
    <p class="text">The concept behind PIM management (product information management) has gained its prominence around 2003 due to dramatic increase in the ecommerce market share and popularity of online stores. </p>
    <p class="text">The main reasons for PIM management rise in popularity were:</p>
    <p class="text">•	The demand for clear product descriptions that could be easily understood by the consumers. When selling online companies need to collect and provide clear basic product information like the name of the product, its category and price. Without these the customers would simply not be able to find the product online to make a purchase.</p>
    <p class="text">•	A wider range of products that can be offered online compared to physical retail stores. It is definitely hard to manage all of the product data in the spreadsheet and not go crazy. While it was still technically possible, as most online stores started offer thousands upon thousands of products, it is becoming increasingly challenging every day. On top of that, the products are now offered not just simply via a website, but also through a large number of other channels such as physical store catalogs, mobile phones and tablets, printed catalogs, etc. This kind of evolution has caused an increasing demand for specialized systems that would offer their users a convenient way to manage all this information even when it’s so widely distributed. The worldwide market for product sales and distribution is becoming more and more complex, as companies are striving to have multiple brands across multiple countries with varying price lists and local promotions, all while building their supplier and distributor networks that often consist of thousands of partners! It is now obvious that this scale of complexity that’s becoming prominent on the market can no longer be managed without having advanced processes and systems like PIM in place.</p> 
    <p class="text">•	The growing demand for better, more detailed, coherent and consistent product information. The rule of thumb is the more information you provide, the better the sales. A well-detailed product description is typically considered one of the most critical elements of an online store. When looking to purchase a product online, customers in most cases want to browse and compare multiple options, see details and know all the specifications before they make the final decision to buy. People also shop online for services, such as tickets or training courses for example and more consumers these days look to download their digital books or games as well. Additionally, as the technologies develop, the standards rise, too. Today’s customers would no longer accept a fuzzy picture - everyone wants to see good quality high resolution photos, videos and 3D models.</p>
    <p class="text">•	The increased amount of legal information about the products’ manufacturing information, materials source etc. These days sellers are legally obliged to store more information about their products than they used to. For example, the source of the materials, details on how a product was manufactured and so on. </p>
    <p class="text">The product information management systems take the central position between various sources of product information and all the distribution channels that a PIM exports its data to.</p>
    <h2>What product information management is used for? Product information management definition.</h2>
    <p class="text">Keeping product information accurate and up-to-date at all times is critical for ecommerce organizations – having full control over this aspect prevents companies from having outdated data have an impact on sales or customer experience.  </p>
    <p class="text"><u>For example:</u></p>
    <p class="text"><i>Somewhere along the process certain materials used in manufacturing a product have been replaced by more advanced ones. </i></p>
    <p class="text"><i>PIM will be able to make sure that all the related channels, such as product databases, information on the web sites, CRM systems, etc. have accurate information about the product including the most recent changes in the manufacturing process. In addition, product information management systems minimize delays on downstream processes when production conditions change, thus accelerating time to market and improving customer experience.  </i></p>     
    <p class="text">Besides being a relevant software for regular retailers and manufacturers, PIM management is also used for a wide range of products and their frequently changing characteristics, online business and electronic commerce. In order to exceed in providing the best service, product information management solutions must: </p>
    <p class="text">•	Collect all the information from multiple separate sources into a single centralized one;</p>
    <p class="text">•	Locate and eliminate problematic or damaged data;</p>
    <p class="text">•	Offer automation of many e-commerce business data processes;</p>
    <p class="text">•	Possess a search tool as well as a filtering tool;</p>
    <p class="text">•	Work with effective search engine software; </p>
    <p class="text">•	Manage product listings and organize them into categories; </p>
    <p class="text">•	Promote and market products using retail, social media and sales channels.</p>
