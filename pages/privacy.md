        We handle certain information, which may include Personal Data, relating to our Customers’ own customers or end users (“Customer Information”) as a service provider on behalf of our Customers. We only process Customer Information as provided in the Terms of service, Privacy Policy and per our Customers’ instructions. For purposes of the GDPR we are the processor and not the controller of the Customer Information.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Virto Commerce does not own, control or direct the use of any of the Customer Information stored or processed by a Customer or end-user via the Service. Only the Customer or end-users are entitled to access, retrieve and direct the use of such Customer Information. Virto Commerce is largely unaware of what Customer Information is actually being stored or made available by a Customer or end-user to the Service and does not directly access such Customer Information except as necessary to provide Services (including to respond to support requests, provide development works, maintenance, updates, etc.), as otherwise authorized by Customers or as required by law. Virto Commerce is not responsible for the content of the Personal Data contained in Customer Information or other information stored on its servers (or its subcontractors’ servers) at the discretion of the Customer nor is Virto Commerce responsible for the manner in which the Customer collects, handles disclosure, distributes or otherwise processes such information.

    <p class="text">
        Our Customers are the “controllers” of Customer Information, meaning that they control the manner such information is collected and used as well as the determination of the purposes and means of the processing of such information and are responsible for compliance with the applicable data protection law. In addition, such information may be subject to our Customers’ own privacy policies. As the controller, it shall be our Customers’ responsibility to inform the end-users about the processing, and, where required, obtain necessary consent or authorization for any Personal Data that is collected as part of the Customer Information through your use of the Service(s).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        As the processors of Customer Information on behalf of our Customers, we follow Customers’ instructions with respect to the Customer Information to the extent consistent with the functionality of our Service(s). In doing so, we implemented reasonable technical and organizational measures against unauthorized processing of such information and against loss, destruction of, or damage to, Customer Information.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        You expressly authorize us and the service providers we use to process the Customer Information in our systems to (i) provide, improve, enhance, support and operate the Service(s) and its availability; (ii) develop new products and services; and (iii) compile statistical reports and record insights into usage patterns; (iv) to utilize third parties services to assist in providing the Service(s) with whom Customer Information may be shared; (v) to the processing and transfer of Customer Information in and to the United States and other countries which may have different privacy laws from your or their country of residence. You are representing that you have the authority to provide such authorization. If you need a signed Data Processing Addendum in addition to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, it can be provided upon request.

        If you seek access to, or wish to correct, update, modify or delete Personal Data which is part of the Customer Information and processed by us as data processor on behalf of our Customer, you should direct your query to our Customer, i.e. the controller. If you are a Customer of our Service(s) and wish to raise a request on behalf of your end-users in connection with Customer Data, you may open a ticket on the support portal of the relevant Service.
