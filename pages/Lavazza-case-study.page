They needed to respond to both B2B and B2C customers&#39; needs for a better online shopping experience, personalized transactions, up-to-date customer insights, and product information. The implementation was technically complex because other systems needed to link and integrate seamlessly across Lavaza&#39;s ecosystem. Furthermore, the B2B and B2C activities had to be unified to streamline workflow and avoid managing multiple catalogs and duplicate work on the backend. Lavazza searched for a robust and flexible ecommerce platform and selected Virto Commerce because it could handle this data integration, be deployed in multiple countries, and was both flexible and scalable.</p>\n",
