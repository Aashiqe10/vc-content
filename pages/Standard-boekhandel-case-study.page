Competition in online book sales is fierce. Having the best product offering in books and the most user-friendly ordering site which links seamlessly to all your systems are basic but critical requirements for success. Such an omnichannel experience requires a flexible and stable commerce platform capable of aligning online and offline ordering through integration with the cash registration systems, resulting in a faster and more efficient ordering process.</p>\n\n<h4>REPLATFORMING HELPED OVERCOME COMMERCE LIMITATIONS</h4>\n\n<p>Standaard Boekhandel chose to replatform to Virto Commerce in order to gain capabilities they did not have on SAP Hybris so that they could extend their product offering, integrate efficiently with different channels, and improve the search functionality for their two brands. Because they were facing limitations with their previous commerce tool, they wanted to migrate to a more flexible and sustainable platform.&nbsp;</p>\n",
