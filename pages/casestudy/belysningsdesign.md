                    Founded in 2006 Belysningsdesign has a long history in the industry and is one of today's leading
                    online lighting stores in Scandinavia. With an active customer base of nearly 48 000 buyers, Belysningsdesign
                    has taken a unique position on the market offering a wide variety of brands in a broad
                    price range. Belysningsdesign started well before e-commerce had a breakthrough, and has always
                    aspired to be the most customer-oriented business selling lighting in Scandinavia.
                    Belysningsdesign focuses on putting user experience at the head of the table. A new system with a
                    web platform allows the company to meet that goal as well as to adapt to future e-commerce business
                    needs.

                <h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the most time-consuming tasks for the company was product content and therefore
                    they wanted to refine the process and make sure that it goes as fast as possible without
                    losing quality in their work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was a challenging task to make sure that the content got migrated in a correct way and to
                    get all the associations (cross-sell, up-sell etc) to the new database. Some integrations with
                    Nav and Episerver have proven to be fairly time-consuming, but not impossible.
