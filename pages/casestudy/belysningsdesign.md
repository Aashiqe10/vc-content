                <h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the most time-consuming tasks for the company was product content and therefore
                    they wanted to refine the process and make sure that it goes as fast as possible without
                    losing quality in their work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was a challenging task to make sure that the content got migrated in a correct way and to
                    get all the associations (cross-sell, up-sell etc) to the new database. Some integrations with
                    Nav and Episerver have proven to be fairly time-consuming, but not impossible.
