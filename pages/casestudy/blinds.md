                <blockquote>
                    The Virto platform allowed to get started quickly towards our customized
                    solution. The documentation and feedback from the VC team helped us
                    get familiar with functionality, which made it easier to extend the codebase
                    for our clientâ€™s needs.

                <h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
                <p>
                    The e-commerce site, built While the product set of blinds, shades, shutters and drapes was still
                    being finalized, had to be flexible for the ultimate product set, managing in stock and custom orders.
                    Along with the visualization and ordering needs, the client also looked for guidance on live chat, tax,
                    credit card and accounting systems.
