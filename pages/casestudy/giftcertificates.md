                <blockquote>
                    The new platform takes advantage of a lot of the latest thoughts on high
                    performance, high quality software development. By adopting this
                    solution, we are adopting technologies that will allow us to better structure
                    how we build the rest of our systems internally. It’s the flagship for our reengineering
                    of our technology practices.

                <h4>CHALLENGE</h4>
                <p>
                    As a major provider of gift card incentives, GC Incentives’ ecommerce platform included more than
                    300 merchants, housed 5000 different company sites, and served 10 million users. A high degree of
                    customization was required to meet the variable needs of each company. Because the platform was
                    outsourced, it hindered GC Incentive’s ability to quickly add new capabilities and services in response
                    to those needs.
                    In addition, over time unique sites were created for each company, leading to a large number of
                    multiple redundancies of similar solutions and an unwieldy level of complexity.
