                    Virto Commerce let us reduce the number of people
                    involved in management of promotions from six to
                    one. We donâ€™t depend on IT guys anymore, and
                    everybody benefits from this.

                <p>
                    To manage the thousands of items it sells, Kitmall needed an e-commerce platform that could:
                    <ul style="padding-left: 40px;">
                        <li>
                            Provide product catalogs with maximum flexibility for merchandising and promotional
                            activities.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Make all product catalogs uniform and consistent, even if the catalogs were from different
                            suppliers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Quickly adjust to a changing market by allowing immediate changes in prices, promotions,
                            and discounts.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col __col-30">
                {% include 'case-study-download', downloadUrl: "../assets/files/kitmall-case-study.pdf" %}
