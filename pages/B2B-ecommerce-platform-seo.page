This means that, for a successful B2B ecommerce solutions implementation, both short and long term, the architecture and functionality of the platform needs to be specific to the B2B market. So while certain business activities, such as a product marketplace, may seem similar between B2B and B2C, the actual business logic and processes are drastically different.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CLOUD-BASED BEST B2B ECOMMERCE PLATFORM</strong></p>\n\n<p>By using a cloud in B2B ecommerce software, businesses are able to eliminate infrastructural limitations that hinder business growth. With this limitation removed, departments can grow and adapt as fast as they need to. With instant, on-demand scaling, marketing campaigns can be executed as fast as they need to, while transparent budgeting allows for easier budget planning and accounting. Plus, with fast upgrades and low maintenance, time can be spent on tasks that affect the bottom line, such as developing new business models or expanding distributor models.</p>\n\n<p><strong>OPEN SOURCE B2B ECOMMERCE SOFTWARE</strong></p>\n\n<p>These days, companies expect tools that allow them to adapt to market trends, with the shortest time-to-market. This is no different for B2B ecommerce software, where flexibility is especially important. Open source is the market standard now, which in turn helps reduce implementation risks, as well as making team training and support easier.</p>\n",
