A high degree of customization was required to meet the variable needs of each company. Because the platform was outsourced, it hindered GC Incentive&rsquo;s ability to quickly add new capabilities and services in response to those needs. In addition, over time unique sites were created for each company, leading to a large number of multiple redundancies of similar solutions and an unwieldy level of complexity.</p>\n",
