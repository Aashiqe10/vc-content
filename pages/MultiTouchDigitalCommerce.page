Additionally, a traditional ecommerce platform lacks the flexibility B2B businesses need to quickly APIfy other providers, data or solutions into their ecommerce front end, providing a coherent user experience across multi touch points.</p>\n\n<p>Choosing a platform with a traditional approach may be ok for a small store, but B2B businesses who strive to provide consistency across channels should consider more flexible platforms. Virto Commerce&#39;s headless architecture separates the content presentation layer that your end customers see from the back end business logic and functional layer. This makes Virto Commerce&#39;s platform superior for B2B and other large businesses as it allows for flexibility, is extensible, provides a personalized B2C like experience, and doesn&#39;t restrict your growth. Headless design allows for unlimited customization, more flexibility in content delivery and a better user experience overall.</p>\n",
