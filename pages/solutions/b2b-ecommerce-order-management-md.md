                                B2B customers expect more from vendors, and they won't settle for a poor order management process. Overlooking order management and giving your customers a subpar buying journey will lead to unsatisfied buyers and loss of revenue. As new generations of buyers are even more tech savvy, streamlined order management is the backbone of your B2B digital commerce solution.
