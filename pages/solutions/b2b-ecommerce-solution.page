At the same time, entering the B2B market causes an additional entry to the&nbsp;B2C market for&nbsp;companies who have never before worked with end-customers directly. All together, this&nbsp;creates opportunities for companies who embark on ecommerce immediately.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, most&nbsp;B2B companies who start their digital transformation don&rsquo;t have the experience doing such ecommerce projects,&nbsp;and therefore, don&rsquo;t have&nbsp;the related expertise. Business, technical, organizational challenges all create risks for ecommerce projects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is common practice to rely on IT implementation partners when undergoing a digital transformation. The problem is that there are very few system integrators and digital agencies who really have expertise in B2B ecommerce. B2C ecommerce experience is easier to find but it doesn&rsquo;t fit the B2B market.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Quite often companies try to apply their B2C experience to B2B situations, but this doesn&rsquo;t really work. B2B ecommerce is much more complicated than B2C, and most solutions and practices, which work for B2C, don&rsquo;t fit B2B ecommerce. B2B ecommerce requires&nbsp;additional complex rules, processes, entities and even interfaces. Employee-users are not equal to physical bodies, humans are not the only kind of users in B2B, and UI is not the only interface.</p>\n",
