At the same time, entering the B2B market causes an additional entry to the&nbsp;B2C market for&nbsp;companies who have never before worked with end-customers directly. All together, this&nbsp;creates opportunities for companies who embark on e-commerce immediately.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, most&nbsp;B2B companies who start their digital transformation don&rsquo;t have the experience doing such e-commerce projects,&nbsp;and therefore, don&rsquo;t have&nbsp;the related expertise. Business, technical, organizational challenges all create risks for e-commerce projects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is common practice to rely on IT implementation partners when undergoing a digital transformation. The problem is that there are very few system integrators and digital agencies who really have expertise in B2B e-commerce. B2C e-commerce experience is easier to find but it doesn&rsquo;t fit the B2B market.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Quite often companies try to apply their B2C experience to B2B situations, but this doesn&rsquo;t really work. B2B e-commerce is much more complicated than B2C, and most solutions and practices, which work for B2C, don&rsquo;t fit B2B e-commerce. B2B e-commerce requires&nbsp;additional complex rules, processes, entities and even interfaces.
