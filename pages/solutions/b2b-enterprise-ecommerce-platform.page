The success of our customers is proof of our method: we efficiently build&nbsp;local Virto Commerce solutions and then generalize the&nbsp;common rules, practices, integrations and requirements across a more standardized&nbsp;platform -- extending it out across regions and countries.</p>\n\n<p><strong>API-Based. </strong>Virto Commerce is an API-based modular ecommerce solution. It can be embedded into any process or replace any function without running a huge project. You can start substituting your legacy systems, improve their process structure or add new functionality without creating additional risks.</p>\n",
