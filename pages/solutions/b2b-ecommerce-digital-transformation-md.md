                            Digital transformation refers to leveraging technology as a company to fundamentally change the way you serve your customers and deliver products. Digital transformation involves applying new technology to your existing business to create new processes that drive revenue and business growth.

                                At the heart of digital transformation is change management, and each business will have its own unique change management process and challenges. From moving your B2B business online for the first time, changing your distribution methods, to revamping your technology stack – change management relies heavily on your organization and its people to be successful. To undertake digital transformation, you must first define the business processes that need to change, and then you must determine how that will change the organization of your team.

                                The technology department of your business is not able to drive digital transformation on its own. Organizational change requires collaboration across different functions – including finance, marketing, and HR. Digital transformation creates an opportunity for ecommerce and technology to become the key driver of digital capabilities that drive revenue.

                                The next step in your transformation is to find the right technology, because the solution you choose and its architecture are going to be the core of your ecommerce business. Radical organizational change will take many turns along the way, and to accommodate the volatile nature of digital change, it is essential to rely on technology that is agile, scalable, and flexible. Choosing an out-of-the-box solution may be convenient, but is limiting in the long run. Your implementation will touch all aspects of your enterprise – and drive your customer experience – so don't choose hastily.

                                After technology, digital transformation relies on people, and your organization working together with your partner. Many large ecommerce vendors offer solutions – but will they take the time to work hand and hand with you in the long run? Choosing a smaller partner will guarantee the importance of your project, getting you better service and more experience to guide your journey.

                                Finally, implementation strategy is another key consideration. Look for a vendor that offers you a proof of concept, which will help ensure a good fit with the solution and your needs. After the proof of concept, they should have a defined delivery process to minimize expensive delays in deployment.
