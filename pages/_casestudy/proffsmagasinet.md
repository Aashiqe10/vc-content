                        We are a fast growing business, so we need a platform that would not only
                        allow us to expand, but also keep up with the ever growing needs and demands
                        of our sales strategies. Virto Commerce definitely ticks those boxes
                        being easily scalable and extremely flexible. By switching to this solution, we
                        are adopting technologies that will allow us to add new channels easily and
                        customize the product catalog for each of them, while keeping track of the
                        overall sales and assortment.

                        Sweden's Proffsmagasinet is a leading e-commerce company in the Nordic region that provides
                        tools, laser and measuring apparatus and other equipment for professionals in the building trade with
                        multiple payment and delivery options online.

                    <p>
                        The company is growing fast! The old system couldnâ€™t keep up with such fast growth and Proffsmagasinet
                        needed to implement lots of new system where the e-commerce platform is the core.
                        Though, the e-commerce platform needed to be able to easily integrate with the ERP system and
                        other third-party systems. Proffsmagasinet wanted to be able to customize the platform according to
                        their need and current business opportunities. The new platform also needed to be able to automatically
                        scale up and down depending on spikes in traffic during campaigns.
