        <p class="text">
            Choosing an ecommerce platform can be overwhelming taking in the account a number of options that have appeared in the recent years. Just like purchasing any product, whether it is a house, a car or a cell-phone, each particular business has to do its research and correctly determine what it is looking for, remembering to consider all the tradeoffs among the available choices. In the past couple years, e-commerce platforms have been gaining popularity among small businesses thanks to their ease of use, usability and availability of a large developer community. Web-developers may provide personal and professional services to the platform client, and you will be most likely to receive good support in the long run from a digital commerce platform.

        <h2>Best ecommerce platform</h2>
        <p class="text">
            There are hundreds of options available on the market of e-commerce platforms with no single “best e-commerce platform” as they all vary in functionality, features, usability and offer many different choices of building a website, accounting for your personal needs, resources and preferences. Some of the universal features that any online store platform has to have are:
        </p>
        <p class="text">1. Availability of listing and displaying products, with the ability of comparison between them</p>
		<p class="text">2. Allowing your buyers to put products into the “Shopping Cart”</p>
		<p class="text">3. Allowing your customers to place an order from their cart later</p>
		<p class="text">4. Collecting payments and offering multiple payment options for the orders</p>
		<p class="text">5. Providing the store owner and the customer with information about the order</p>
		<p class="text">6. Allowing the customer to place feedback or a review</p>
		<p class="text">
            And these useful features do not stop there. Some of the top ecommerce platforms will provide you with certain eccentricities like unique design features, additional security options, marketing tools and so on. With all of that in mind the best way to go is to choose a platform that offers the maximum output for your business and provides you with the most convenience at the lowest cost.

        <h2>Questions to ask youself while choosing the online store platform</h2>
        <p class="text">
            What is the best ecommerce platform? While picking the right platform for you, consider asking yourself the following questions:
        </p>
        <p class="text">1. Stock size. What is the size of your inventory? Try to find the platform where you will be able to create flexible product catalogs with the ability to list thousands of product items without loosing website performance.</p>
		<p class="text">2. Physical or digital. Do you provide online services or physical products? It will make you think about shipping costs and the ways your product will be delivered to your customer. There are ecommerce platforms that are specifically tied to physical or digital goods’ sales.</p>
		<p class="text">3. Payment methods. Not all online store platforms choose third-party payment methods, and you need to consider this as well. PayPal is usually a good option that is easy to use in making arrangements with the best ecommerce platforms. Stripe is also the “must-have” for the platform in 2017.</p>
		<p class="text">4. Self-hosted or hosted by the platform. The option of self-hosting a website is more preferable to you in case you want to control the source code of your online store and modify it on a regular basis. Platform-hosted solutions save your time taking care of server management and system administration.</p>
		<p class="text">Considering that choosing a platform can be challenging and daunting, in this article, we wanted to review the top ecommerce platforms that will match your needs and will provide you with a perfect solution for your business.</p>
		<h2>Shopify</h2>
        <div style="display: table;">
            <div style="display: table-row;">
                <div style="display: table-cell; width: 50%;">
                    <img alt="Ecommerce Platforms - Shopify" src="assets/images/shopify1.jpg" />
                </div>
                <div style="display: table-cell; padding-left: 20px; vertical-align: top;">
		<p class="text">Shopify is the best platform for an e-commerce website when it comes to balancing the convenience of setting up a website and having the control over it. The great advantage of such category of electronic commerce platforms, including Shopify, is that it provides you with as much control as possible without using your own server. It can get a little bit pricey for small businesses, but the biggest advantage is outstanding customer support and advanced tools for modifying your website. Shopify deals perfectly with its mission and offers you a robust product experience along with advanced tools for marketing in e-commerce. A website built on this platform would be fast and secure, and would have all the necessary features we have brought up earlier in the article. Trying to accommodate all the features that store owners need, Shopify took an example from Apple and Google and started its own App Store. There is no need to go searching a developer every time you need a particular feature in your app anymore - Shopify’s App Store offers a much cheaper and faster alternative.</p>
		<p class="text">Despite having a number of fantastic features, such as great customer service, advanced tools and App Store, just like any other ecommerce platform, Shopify  lacks certain important tools. Content marketing is the biggest of them. Content marketing has become a huge must-have for an ecommerce website. If your buyers are educated about the solutions your product can provide, they are more likely to buy it. Shopify has a blogging software feature, but it can’t be compared to that of a Wordpress. </p>

        <h2>BigCommerce</h2>
        <div style="display: table;">
            <div style="display: table-row;">
                <div style="display: table-cell; padding-right: 20px; vertical-align: top; width: 50%;">
		<p class="text">BigCommerce is Shopify’s direct competitor. Its focus, however, is on online-only merchants. In terms of controls and usability, it is similar to Shopify. However, the feature set and themes are not quite as advanced as Shopify’s, and that is the biggest reason it is falling a little behind.</p>
		<p class="text">The good thing about this platform is a vast variety of how-tos, advice and letters about running a successful store. It doesn’t seem very well-organized, but the information from the BigCommerce University will help you to set up and promote your website. Just like Shopify, it provides a hassle-free set up and security with intuitive features and an all-in-one solution for your website.</p>
		<p class="text">An important thing to consider with this platform is pricing. For a smaller online store it can get too much very fast. There is a whole number of fees, like  monthly fees, credit card fees, platform transaction fees and add-on fees that could drain your budget really quickly. Another one is customization. While having a great variety of built-in options, it lacks add-ons and themes for your website as well as good inventory management.</p>
               </div>
                <div style="display: table-cell;">
                    <img alt="Ecommerce Platforms - BigCommerce" src="assets/images/bigcommerce.jpg" />
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
		<h2>Woocommerce</h2>
        <div style="display: table;">
            <div style="display: table-row;">
                <div style="display: table-cell; width: 50%;">
                    <img alt="Ecommerce Platforms - Woocommerce" src="assets/images/woocommerce.jpg" />
                </div>
                <div style="display: table-cell; padding-left: 20px; vertical-align: top;">
		<p class="text">Woocommerce is a WordPress plugin, so you can expect to use all the advantages of WordPress while using this platform for building a website. If you want to make your site classy and easy to navigate, Woocommerce is a great way to go.</p>
		<p class="text">It is free and all you will be spending with it is a bit of time to learn about the platform’s features and how WordPress works with e-commerce websites. The incredibly intuitive panel is the main advantage of this platform, allowing you to look up the extensions and plugins for your site, to fully optimize it.</p>
		<p class="text">Woocommerce website needs to be self-hosted, offering you a huge advantage of modifying your website, but requiring the use of your own servers.</p>
                </div>

		<h2>Magento</h2>
        <div style="display: table;">
            <div style="display: table-row;">
                <div style="display: table-cell; padding-right: 20px; vertical-align: top; width: 50%;">
		<p class="text">Magento is a huge independent company that is currently on the rise and continues to be an enterprise-level player in the field of the best ecommerce platforms, offering a wide range of business solutions to its customers, including certain big companies like Burger King, Coca-Cola and etc. It is elastic and provides excellent support to large corporations, while not forgetting about small businesses either. Given its open-source features and being very scalable, Magento has become very popular within the community. However, it requires a lot of research and programming knowledge in order to use it. </p>
		<p class="text">If you are planning to have a serious platform, Magento would be a great choice.. However, if you are just looking for a simple and basic solution that is easy to integrate on your own, Magento might be a bit of overkill.</p>
               </div>
                <div style="display: table-cell;">
                    <img alt="Ecommerce Platforms - Magento" src="assets/images/magento.jpg" />

		<h2>Volusion</h2>
        <div style="display: table;">
            <div style="display: table-row;">
                <div style="display: table-cell; width: 50%;">
                    <img alt="Ecommerce Platforms - Volusion" src="assets/images/volusion1.jpg" />
                </div>
		<p class="text">Volusion is a simple website creation tool. It is another popular platform just like Shopify and BigCommerce that offers some notable features that are highly appreciated by designers and developers. If you are more dedicated to the operational side of an ecommerce store than to its marketing-led features, you may consider choosing Volusion over BigCommerce. Like Shopify and BigCommerce, Volusion offers a perfect balance between providing everything you need to set up, operate and expand your business and leaving some space for your personal customization. Also, just like BigCommerce, Volusion offers a vast knowledgebase, where you can get help setting up an online store of your own. Volusion even takes it a step further by featuring account specialists – personnel, who will assist you directly in building your website.</p>
		<p class="text">Another area where Volusion excels is customer support. The team puts a tremendous amount of effort in making sure their clients have the best experience.</p>
		<p class="text">Having these beautiful features as well as the full range of tools for marketing, Volusion however has some of the disadvantages of its own. Just like its two competitors, the big one is, of course, pricing. While having no transaction fees and lower credit card fees compared to the competitors, it does charge a lot of add-on fees, which may turn out to be expensive for a smaller company. Two other disadvantages include limited responsiveness and design options. In the age where most of the people surf the web via smartphones and tablets, it has become the best practice to have a responsive design. As for the design options, Volusion has a fairly limited choice of templates, while also making the new ones very expensive to use. </p>

		<h2>3dCart</h2>
        <div style="display: table;">
            <div style="display: table-row;">
                <div style="display: table-cell; padding-right: 20px; vertical-align: top; width: 50%;">
		<p class="text">Despite the fact that it makes you wonder about whether they are going to update the website or not, it still does the trick of providing what you need most of the time. 3dcart offers great tutorials and tools for deciding on anything from a template of your website to defining your shipping options. This platform is well-suited for beginners and makes wizardry of keeping it all simple.</p>
		<p class="text">The features are plentiful in this platform, and you can find that all of them are built-in, offering you things like blog, newsletter, e-mail and CRM. Also, if you are an advanced web developer, you may find some great options for you to get in there and customize your website.</p>
		<p class="text">While having useful apps and add-ons, 3dcart still lacks the variety of them unlike its competitors Shopify or BigCommerce.</p>
		<p class="text">The process of making a website is straightforward and intuitive, offering some tutorials for you along the process. The support is smooth and reliable, but without any interesting features that other companies don’t have. 3dcart also offers a big variety of responsive templates and a great set of tools for marketing and inventory.</p>
               </div>

		<h2>Digital commerce platform for your business - Conslusions</h2>
		<p class="text">There is no single “best platform for ecommerce website” and the choice of one will always be upon you. None of the platforms offer a “one size fits all” solution, and it’s up to you to consider different options depending on your solution. To choose the ecommerce engine define the solution features and configuration that you need in advance. Test the platforms with the necessary features using trial versions, compare support and documentation during the trial period – this will give you a better understanding of the customer service.</p>
