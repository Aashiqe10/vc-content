        <p class="text">E procurement software is the enterprise system that automates and integrates the spectrum of an organization's procurement cycle. A good e procurement software solution will increase transparency associated with spending and approval processes.</p>
        <p class="text">For example, an online procurement as a part of an e procurement system allows customers to browse online catalogs, add goods to the shopping cart, and send requisition. However, online procurement automation goes far beyond the online shopping experience. Online procurement involves many of the procedures, functions, and workflows, which make the e procurement fast and cost-effective. Its implementation allows to reduce manual errors and paper-based processes due to smart automation and visibility of your purchasing mechanism. E procurement platform removes most document operations from the procurement team, which can focus on high-value tasks, not paperwork.</p>
        <p class="text">Effective e procurement platform streamlines the procurement procedures and delivers visible cost-saving results.</p>
        <p class="text">Of course, e procurement platform offers differ in features and provided options. Some of them are suited for big corporations, while other solutions are less complex and fit better for small or medium businesses.</p>

        <div class="section-title-h3">Offline Procurement processes</div>
        <p class="text">Procurement departments have the important role in almost every company regardless of its size. </p>
        <p class="text">Procurement employees can be purchasing office supplies or they could be working with the most complex orders for an organization, including wholesale and retail equipment. Procurement solutions are meant to make this process easier and faster.</p>
        <p class="text">Procurement system is essentially a set of processes that consist of a number of steps as well as interactions with the other departments of the company and with suppliers.  Traditional procurement involves getting quotes and approvals, as well as preparing and submitting purchase orders.</p>
        <p class="text">Procurement manager’s responsibilities involve the strategic planning to cut procurement expenses and searching for cost-effective deals and suppliers. A good procurement system provides many opportunities for cost savings that can make a significant difference to a company's budget. </p>
        <p class="text">Traditional procurement and electronic procurement solutions both have advantages and disadvantages.</p>
        <p class="text">An e procurement system manages an e-commerce web site's offers/bids and can be used interchangeably with procurement software. It is designed to optimize purchasing processes and increase transparency with regard to the spending and approval processes. E-procurement essentially transfers the whole procurement process to the online field eliminating some steps and thus saving budget. </p>
        <div class="section-title-h3">E procurement tools and services</div>
        <p class="text">Some companies outsource their e procurement needs to third party procurement service providers (PSPs) that will design and manage internet based procurement programs on their behalf for a fee. Time and resources are required for a company to maintain domain expertise across every facet of spending. Assistance from a PSP increases the likelihood that company buying decisions remain strategic.</p>
