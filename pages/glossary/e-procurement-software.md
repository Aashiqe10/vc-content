    <h2 class="sub-title">What is e-procurement software?</h2>
    <p class="text">E-procurement software is enterprise software that automates and integrates the spectrum of an organization's procurement cycle. A good e-procurement software solution will increase transparency associated with spending and approval processes.</p>
    <p class="text">For example, an e-procurement system allows customers to browse online catalogs, add goods to the shopping cart, and send requisition. However, online e-procurement automation goes far beyond the online shopping experience. It involves many of the procedures, functions, and workflows, which make the e-procurement fast and cost-effective. Its implementation allows to reduce manual errors and paper-based processes due to smart automation and visibility of your purchasing mechanism. E-procurement software removes most document operations from the procurement team, which can focus on high-value tasks, not paperwork.</p>
    <p class="text">Effective e procurement platform streamlines the procurement procedures and delivers visible cost-saving results.</p>
    <p class="text">Of course, procurement software offers differ in features and provided options. Some of them are suited for big corporations, while other solutions are less complex and fit better for small or medium businesses.</p>

Assistance from a PSP increases the likelihood that company buying decisions remain strategic.</p>
