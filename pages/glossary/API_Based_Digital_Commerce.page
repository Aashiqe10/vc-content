        "content": "<p>The simplest method of understanding API-based digital commerce is by first understanding&nbsp;how application programming interfaces (APIs) work. An API is an application that allows two applications to communicate with one another through commands designed by expert programmers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>API-based digital commerce systems have been a massive breath of fresh air in the business sector because of a couple of reasons. For instance, this multi-application communication platform can be initiated by a customer who is executing a particular command on the B2B e-commerce portal. Here, an order kick starts the shipment of a product from the factory to the distribution center.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You can even use an application like Expedia to book a flight to see a client, or pos a picture on Instagram to advertise your products. What&#39;s clear is that using an API-based digital commerce system, you can facilitate the safe sharing of information from one app to another. Hence, that&#39;s why there are a lot of API-Based digital commerce systems use data from social messaging, payments, finance, Bitcoin, e-commerce and several other categories.&nbsp;</p>\n",

        "content": "<p class=\"section__descr--medium\"><strong>Product Information APIs&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>Using this API-based digital commerce system, you can easily connect your product webpage catalogs directly using a global database. It will assist you in sharing detailed information on the products on sale. You can even use it to display things like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Product descriptions</li>\n\t<li>Brand images</li>\n\t<li>Full product titles</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Social Proof Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Some of the primary examples of Social Proof API-Based digital commerce system include sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. How are they being used? Companies advertise their services by sharing Twitter comments, Facebook likes as well as product reviews.&nbsp;<br />\nThese are known as social media trust signals, and many companies are benefiting from them.&nbsp;<br />\nYou can also use API-Based digital commerce systems to stream messages from social media directly to the product pages on their website. For instance, thanks to the Twitter API, there are widgets which they can now use to show all recent comments on products from their customers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Site Search API-Based Digital Commerce Tool</strong></p>\n\n<p>When you provide detailed search features on your website, you improve your customer&#39;s shopping experience. With this API digital commerce system, you can help your online visitors to scroll through and discover unique items or brands with only a few clicks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Of course, there are retail shops with extensive web pages. Thankfully, this search API tool is there to ensure that help visitors quickly search for a given product.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Programs for Shipping Goods</strong></p>\n\n<p>To create a trustworthy shopping and business environment, online retailers can integrate their drop shipments with delivery APIs. Here, they can automate different processes from the point of sale, right until the point when the parcel is delivered at the customer&#39;s doorstep.&nbsp;<br />\nSo, as a retailer, you should activate the shipping API on your company&#39;s website as soon as you make the sale. This allows both parties to keep track of the shipment, every step of the way, until it arrives at its destination.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
