    <p class="text">
    Order processing software is a system that is specifically tailored to manage businesses’ time properly by reducing the length of the sales order processing. With a good order processing software, your business will be able to improve operational efficiency, increase revenues, eliminate billing errors, and deliver the highest level of customer satisfaction. Besides that, the right order fulfillment software enables you to track order-to-cash processes and to integrate unique billing capabilities.  
    </p>
    <div class="section-title">Criteria for Choosing a Great Order Processing Software</div>
    <p class="text">
    Outstanding order processing software should have these following features to help businesses increase their efficiency:
    </p>
    <p class="text">•	Order tracking software that integrates business process across all of the branches of the company;</p>
    <p class="text">•	Price tracking system to count for the latest discounts and price rules;</p>
    <p class="text">•	Sales order tracking software that enables tracking the shipping process through major delivery companies, such as USPS, UPS, FedEx;</p>
    <p class="text">•	Great return process with quick authorization and order tracking software;</p>
    <p class="text">•	Enhance sales order processing by integrating faster invoicing, billing and record creation. </p>
    <div class="section-title">Multi-Channel Order Processing</div>
    <p class="text">
        In the modern day multi-channel is a major concept in ecommerce and your order fulfillment software needs to be able to work with it! An advanced order tracking software will help you streamline and centralize your operations. The main functions it needs to be able to perform are:
    </p>
        <p class="text">•	syncing orders;</p>

        In addition to unifying order processing from different channels your order processing software needs to allow for all the key stakeholders in the process to be able to work together and communicate effectively. Far too often, the stakeholders simply don’t have the right technology to focus on the most valuable aspects of their work. In order to address that every sales order needs to be properly documented and fully visible to all the necessary team members, so that team members are free to optimize their daily tasks.
