			<h1 class="title">Agile Platform-Definition</h1>
		</div>
		<p class="text">A series of software technology tools which embody agile principles comprising an online retail or e-commerce website. Agile principles are derived from the agile manifesto which outlines 4 important values in software development. It says, "we value: Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Working software over comprehensive documentation. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation and Responding to change over following a plan. That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more."</p>
		<h2 class="sub-title">Why are Agile Software Development Tools valuable</h2>
		<p class="text">Agile software development tools facilitate and enhance developer's ability to plan, track and manage the development of the agile cycle. Agile project management software empowers an organization's product development process by enabling effective planning, providing real-time visibility, incorporating early feedback from customers and facilitating easy collaboration among development teams. Today's marketplace offers a number of powerful open source agile project management tools.</p>
        <h2 class="sub-title">Agile Development Platform from Virto Commerce</h2>
        <p class="text">Virto Commerce is a highly scalable e-commerce agile platform meant for large as well as fast-growing companies. It provides powerful enterprise-level features right out-of-the-box and gives you the flexibility to create your own unique eCommerce solution while utilizing agile principles.</p>
        <p class="text">We use the Agile development methodology to create an extremely flexible and fully adjustable platform with module-based architecture.</p>
        <p class="text">The so-called water flow process, that used to be applied to the development of the full product from the planning stage to release, is now the tale of the past. The entire development process used to go through several stages: analysis, planning, development, testing and only then the release of the final product. It’s a brilliant strategy for creating let’s say a couch…When it comes to software development, however, a lot can change in the world of technology and e-commerce in the 2-3 years it takes to fully develop a product, and no one wants to end up with an outdated result after all this work. So, the old methodology doesn’t cut it anymore. When creating software we need to be able to constantly adjust to the ever changing technological environment and stay on top of the newest trends during the development process.</p>
        <p class="text">Agile product development methodology splits the project into mini-goals, decreasing the length of iterations and making it more flexible. Now, instead of going through the aforementioned main stages of development for the whole process that takes years, you go through them for each little piece separately – that only takes 1-2 months, which makes a huge difference when it comes to flexibility in changing the code.</p>
        <p class="text">Agile platform development process makes it easy to approve every part of the created product with the client or your stakeholders, and it’s easy to change anything that needs changing. The ability to review, customize and make adjustments is implied from the start. So, development and testing of an agile development platform are done in a way where the changes in the code can be applied as painlessly as possible and not have any major impact on the rest of the code.</p>
        <p class="text">When we say the Virto Commerce platform is agile, we are confident that it is ready for this kind of development process! Our platform has a module-based architecture and the co-dependency between the modules is minimal.</p>
        <p class="text">So, for example, if you want to only change the pricing on your products, you can do so without affecting the rest of the catalog at all. </p>
        <p class="text">Modular architecture supports automatic updates to allow solutions to stay up to date with the latest features and fixes. At the same time the use of microservices lets you easily add and remove features, customize any part of the system to your specific business needs, integrate it with third-party software - Virto Commerce platform is ready for any change you might want to apply, it’s made to be agile! We don’t just offer an e-commerce tool – we provide an entire development system from the initial development to the changes in the end product, and then you can decide to use it with your own system/methodology or ours.</p>
        <p class="text">Here is an example of what kind of microservices can be utilized within the Virto Commerce platform:</p>
        <img alt="E commerce platforms" src="assets/images/features/architecture-circle.png" />
        <p class="text">The Virto Commerce e-commerce solution comes with B2C/B2B mechanics, as well as basic out-of-the-box functions and with the ability to add, remove or change anything. Make sure to check our (GitHub code repository)[https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-platform] for the full list of available features and development updates.</p>
        <p class="text">The B2B and B2C mechanics of our agile development platform can be (and have been) implemented easily with an integration to the existing system or with a new website build from scratch.</p>
        <p class="text">Here is one of our latest case studies on the successful implementation:</p>
        <p class="text">-	(GiftCertificates.com  - B2B/B2C Platform Case Study)[https://virtocommerce.com/assets/files/gc-case-study.pdf]</p>
        <p class="text">“The new platform takes advantage of a lot of the latest thoughts on high performance, high quality software development. By adopting this solution, we are adopting technologies that will allow us to better structure how we build the rest of our systems internally. It’s the flagship for our reengineering of our technology practices.” Kevin Cory, VP-Technology and Strategic Planning, GC Incentives.</p>
        <p class="text">With the modular architecture, the use of microservices and general ability of full customization, you'll be able to achieve your unique business goals, convert browsers into buyers and increase online revenue!</p>
