The proper setup of stock keeping units or SKUs means having all items tracked accurately.</p>\n",

When talking about inventory tracking, the most common question that pops up is: &quot;what is an SKU number&quot;? Here&#39;s a short explanation: when new products are received by a business, they need to be properly marked, accounted for and tracked for the business to always have a clear knowledge how many are available. Here&#39;s where SKU numbers come handy. Each product gets assigned one. With that, they can be easily tracked in the inventory management system. This kind of tracking system is essential for keeping track of stock - if the units in a warehouse or storage have SKUs, then stock availability is easy to determine.</p>\n"

From the very definition of SKU, it&#39;s clear that those are used to keep track of the stock units in the most detailed way. Every product variation in a warehouse needs to have its own unique SKU, meaning a business would use a different code for every item in stock. Stock-takes are performed to make sure that the stock levels of the warehouse and of the inventory management system don&#39;t have any discrepancies. The use of SKU productivity definition makes keeping track of the stock levels an easy and straight forward process.</p>\n"
