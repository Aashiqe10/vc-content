Typically the commerce transaction goes through a company website with an online catalog managed by the seller.</p>\n\n<p>What choices does a B2C vendor have when it comes to choosing an ecommerce platform? Many &ndash; and it can be hard to differentiate between ecommerce vendors. Things to consider are: the size of your catalog, the complexity of your product, and the growth you project in your business. Just like with B2B ecommerce, B2C companies need to choose a platform that is agile, flexible, and will be able to change along with the fast pace of their business needs.</p>\n",
