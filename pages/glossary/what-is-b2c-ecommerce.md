        <h1>What is b2c ecommerce </h1>
        <p class="text">
            B2C, the acronym for “business-to-consumer”, is a business model based on transactions between a company, that sells products
            or services, and individual customers who are the end-users of these products. B2C ecommerce definition suggests
            the commerce transaction through a company website featured with online catalog.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Most Internet users are familiar with the B2C ecommerce model. Consumers appreciate the convenience of online shopping where they now can purchase
            clothes, electronics, media subscriptions and services via Internet. In the past couple of years,
            the total online revenue in Europe has been worth about 500 billion euros. And according to reports, the further growth
            of industry is predicted; ecommerce market's full potential has not yet been reached.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            The established players are not always the competition. As on any emerging market, B2C ecommerce participants have
            huge potential in niche and local fragmentation. The winning formulas vary for international multi-channel distributors,
            theme-based online stores, specific deal aggregators, or national closed retailing. But the key challenges are still quite similar for all B2C
            online stores.
        </p>
        <h2>B2C commerce challenges</h2>
        <p class="text">
            There is much more competition and higher demands from the customers in B2C ecommerce then in the business-to-business model. Taking a closer look
            at the B2C store success recipe, we can highlight the following factors.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Consumer traffic</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">
            If Google, Bing, or Yahoo! do not know your name, you do not exist. Search engine marketing and optimization are the lifeblood
            of any online business. The usual consumer behavior's is to transition to a link from the first or second
            page of search results. A B2C website must be optimized to attract traffic; its very structure, architecture, and
            content management system must work for you since its creation. That is why the choice of a website platform is
            vital for the success.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Payment processing </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">
            A lot of customers are hesitant to submit their personal data to websites due to safety reasons. SSL encryption, PCI compliance
            and other trust marks have proven to increase online clients' confidence.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Client support</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">
            Sales are always about the people. The cost of acquiring a new consumer is almost ten times higher than of maintaining an existing loyal
            customer, who typically spends 60% more than a new client. An optimized customer experience encourages visitors to become
            loyal customers. So the biggest emphasis must be placed on improved retention.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            There are many strategies that help make clients feel appreciated. The online shopping needs to be easy for them, it needs to motivate clients to become your partners,
            your brand's advocates. These tactics can be supported with powerful, easy to use tools thet help deliver engaging
            promotions, campaigns and loyalty programs.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Product findability</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">
            Online stores continue to become simpler, more intuitive, and flashy-looking. The convenience of on-site search and navigation is the key component of usability.
            The associations, exact jargon, abbreviations, autocomplete suggestions of the search dictionary, filters and
            refinements, clear product hierarchy - these are the essential features that would dramatically lift conversion rates. If
            a client can’t find a product, he can’t buy it. An online store platform must contain usability-related
            tools to make the searching process as easy as possible for the shoppers who come back to order again.
        </p>
        <h2>B2C commerce solutions</h2>
        <p class="text">
            There are many factors to consider when choosing a B2C ecommerce platform. The following review contains some great solutions for the specific needs of a B2C store.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Shopify is one of the most popular ecommerce platforms to build a feature-rich online store upon without any special
                    web development knowledge. The solution is easy to use and comes with a huge set of store templates. Among the cons
                    is the high price, and lack of migration options, upon canceling your Shopify account your store will be deleted.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Volusion offers a marketing emphasis with a user-friendly search engine and powerful inventory, as well as promotion
                    and shipping tools. The weak points are customer support and unstable hosting servers.
                </p>
            </li>

                    Magento is a free, open-source platform that allows you to create a self-hosted store with scalable architecture
                    and powerful SEO. But coding skills are required to customize the platform to your needs. And you would have
                    to host Magento solution on your own server. Not the best choice for a small company or for a newbie.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>

                    plans for small online stores. As a matter of fact the set of features provided is mainly good for a small store.
                    The extensive enterprise-class customization would be a challenge.
