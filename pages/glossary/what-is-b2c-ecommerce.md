        <h1> What is b2c e-commerce </h1>
        <p class="text">
            B2C, the acronym of “business-to-consumer”, is a business model based on transactions between a company, that sells products
            or services, and individual customers who are the end-users of these products. B2C e-commerce definition suggests
            the commerce transaction through a company website featured with online catalog.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Most Internet users are familiar with B2C e-commerce model. Consumers appreciate the convenience of online shopping and purchase
            clothes, electronics, media subscriptions and services via Internet. As was the case for the last couple of years,
            the total online revenue in Europe was worth about 500 billion euros. And according to reports, the further growth
            of industry is predicted; e-commerce market's full potential has not yet been reached.
        </p>
        <p class="text"> The established players are not always the competition. As any emerging market, b2c e-commerce participants have
            huge potential in niche and local fragmentation. The winning formulas vary for international multi-channel distributors,
            thematic online stores, specific deal aggregators, or national closed retailing. But the key challenges for B2C
            online store are still similar.
        </p>
        <h2> B2C commerce challenges </h2>
        <p class="text">
            There is much more competition and customers' demands in B2C e-commerce then in business-to-business model. In a closer look
            at the B2C store success recipe, the following factors need to be highlighted.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Consumer traffic </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text">
            If Google, Bing, or Yahoo! do not know your name, you do not exist. Search engine marketing and optimization are the lifeblood
            of any online business. The usual mode of consumer behavior is the transition to a link from the first or second
            page of search results. The B2C website must be optimized to get traffic, its very structure, architecture, and
            content management system must work for you since its foundation. That is why the choice of site platform is
            vital for the success.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Payment processing </li>
        </ul>
        <p class='text'>
            A lot of customers are hesitant to submit their personal data to websites due to security reasons. SSL encryption, PCI compliance
            and other trust marks have proven to increase online clients' confidence.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Clients support</li>
        </ul>
        <p class='text'>
            Sales are always about the people. The cost of a new consumer is almost ten times more than maintenance of an existing loyal
            customer, which spends 60% more than new client. An optimized customer experience excites the visitors to become
            loyal, and the biggest emphasis must be placed on improved retention.
        </p>
        <p class='text'>
            There are many strategies to make clients feel cared for. You must make the online shopping easy for them, and motivate the clients to become your partners,
            your brand's advocates. These tactics must be supported with powerful, easy to use tools to deliver engaging
            promotions, campaigns and loyalty programs. Product findability Online stores continue to become simpler, more
            intuitive, and flashier for client. The convenience of on-site search and navigation is a key component of usability.
            The associations, exact jargon, abbreviations, autocomplete suggestions of the search dictionary, filters and
            refinements, clear product hierarchy are the essential features to dramatically lift the conversion rates. If
            a client can’t find a product, he can’t buy it. The online store platform must contain the usability-related
            tools to make the search easy as possible for shoppers who come back and order again.
        </p>
