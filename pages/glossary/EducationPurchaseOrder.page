        "content": "<p>A Purchase Order (PO), or purchase order request form, is a document that is commercial and legally-binding and connects a buyer with a supplier. It indicates types, quantities, and prices for the products or services. It also provides relevant details about a product or service as well as defines the conditions for purchasing from external suppliers. In addition, it sets payment terms, date of shipment, and other terms and conditions. The issue of such an order is not necessarily an initiation of a contract. In case no agreement exists between the buyer and supplier, the confirmation of the purchase order may later serve as a legal binding.</p>\n",

        "content": "<p class=\"section__descr--medium\"><strong>Purchase Order - What is the Purpose of a PO?&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\nPurchase orders or purchase order requests are generally used in case a buyer wants to purchase any supplies on an account. It is used as a legal protection for the supplier, as the supplier sends the product before the payment. Besides providing legal protection, purchase orders are crucial in inventory and payment tracking. They also give suppliers the ability to manage and compare the products that were ordered to the ones that were shipped. It enhances a company&#39;s data management and ensures easy payment tracking. Purchase orders can also serve as legal receipts of the items that were purchased and as a precedent to claim the product or service.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>PO Submission&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\nA purchase order is always prepared by the buyer through the purchasing department. The process of creating a purchase order is usually done via electronic systems which give you the opportunity to track submissions to the supplier. Purchase orders also include a PO number, which can be used to match received shipments with purchases, shipping dates and addresses, quantities and prices, billing addresses and requested items. There are multiple templates on the web for you to follow that also have entry fields for all the necessary data.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Order Processing</strong>&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAs soon as the buyer submits the order to the supplier, an in-progress purchase is created. The status of the order remains that way until the buyer receives the items to his warehouse. After the inventory is delivered, it is scanned into the inventory database and automatically matched to the proper purchase order. It is then processed in the order that requires payment. At this point, the buyer is responsible for paying the supplier the agreed money for the order. The payment itself should include the purchase order number, preferably along with the company&#39;s name and account number.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Use of Purchase Orders on the Supplier Side</strong>&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nPurchase orders are used not only by the buyer. They can be used by the suppliers as well to fulfill payment processing. Upon receiving one, the purchased order is used to start pulling, packaging and shipping the needed inventory. Once it is pulled, it is time for the supplier to create an invoice based on the items that have been prepared for shipment. With purchase order, it is easy to record a product in the inventory, even after it has already been shipped. The requests can be filed electronically with an option to create a paper copy and keep it for your records.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Purchase Order vs. Purchase Invoice&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\nA purchase invoice is used along with purchase order and can show you how much money the supplier still needs to get from the buyer. Invoices can also be called and referred to as &quot;bills,&quot; &quot;statements&quot; or &quot;sales invoices.&quot;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nWith an invoice, you can describe the product that was delivered to the customer as well as the price, as well as payment terms to the buyer. A proper invoice would be organized, well-structured and would include:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Date of issue</li>\n\t<li>Invoice number</li>\n\t<li>PO number</li>\n\t<li>Quantity of products that were ordered</li>\n\t<li>Price for each product purchased</li>\n\t<li>Any applicable discounts</li>\n\t<li>Taxes that apply to the purchase</li>\n\t<li>Total cost of the products</li>\n\t<li>Names and addresses of seller and buyer</li>\n\t<li>Signature of a seller</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"section__descr--medium\"><br />\nWhen an invoice is used properly, it can help small businesses adequately track all expenses and revenue, as well as provide a written record of the goods and services that have been sold. It is also easy to manage buyers&#39; accounts and tell who has an outstanding balance and who still owes money.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nKeeping a proper database of invoices, you will be surprised by how much easier it will be for you to pay your taxes, as it will show you the real amount of money that you have earned over a specific period. There are also invoicing machines that can automatically schedule payment reminders for your customers and notify you about the payments that were received. Therefore, with this in mind, let&#39;s talk about some of the prominent similarities and differences that come up between purchase orders and purchase invoices.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nFirst, the PO is the document that is prepared by the buyer during times when they order products or services. A PI, on the other hand, is used by the supplier to formally request the payment from the buyer for the goods that were sold earlier. This leads to the fact that PO is always sent to the supplier, while invoice is sent the other way around. Additionally, a purchase order lists details and delivery dates, terms and conditions of delivery and the price, while purchase invoice primarily focuses on the circumstances of payment and due dates of payment. Also, a purchase order always precedes an invoice and is issued when the customer places an order. A PO can serve as a detail to the contract, while a PI confirms that the sale happened. Both purchase documents may include information about shipping specifics, delivery dates, POs, and company account numbers. Both reports can also serve as legally-binding papers that ensure the safety of the deal.&nbsp;</p>\n",

This stage is about getting the approval for the money that will be needed in the future.
