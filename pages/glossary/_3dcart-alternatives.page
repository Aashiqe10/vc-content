The dashboard is intuitive and allows for full control over the store, even if its product listings go way over hundreds of products. If you have worked with Wordpress, 3dCart&#39;s dashboard will seem very familiar to you. The platform offers all kinds templates to help you create the unique look of your store, some of which are available for an additional fee. The great thing about this platform is that you are not limited to the drag and drop function for creating your front-end, but can also edit the code directly using HTML and CSS.&nbsp; There is also an app-store you can use to give your website features. The platform itself offers a lot of them, so you won&#39;t need to download multiple add-ons, meaning shorter response time for your website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>3rdCart has some drawbacks. One of them being the limited amount of bandwidth that comes with each plan, making it sub-optimal for larger businesses and B2B companies.&nbsp;</p>\n",

        "content": "<h3>Below are reviews of the top 3dCart alternatives and competitors:</h3>\n\n<p><u><strong><a href=\"https://virtocommerce.com/glossary/shopify-alternatives\">Shopify </a></strong></u>is one of the popular 3dcart competitors. Shopify is popular with B2C customers all over the world for its intuitive design and simple interface. A wide variety of tools and extensions is also offered through Shopify&#39;s unique AppStore to help you to broaden your website&#39;s feature base.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A major downside of Shopify is its inability to successfully market products on the Web. Another factor you should consider before you choose this platform is that it is closed source (proprietary) and requires a significant amount of money to be invested into it. On the other hand, you don&#39;t have to dig deep into its code in order to customize your website. The easy drag and drop functionality will help to quickly set up without any programming involved. Shopify&#39;s customer support is outstanding and will gladly help you along the way of creating your web store.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind though that despite its wonderful features, Shopify is hard to scale and customize, due to its closed source origin, and may not be the right choice for enterprise and B2B ecommerce. Many businesses outgrow Shopify, and have to go through an expensive and time consuming replatforming exercise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>Volusion:</strong></u> Another great alternative to 3dcart is Volusion. Just like Shopify, it is closed source. If you are tech savvy, this platform will impress you with its expandability and functionality. The downside is in content marketing functionality (or rather lack of thereof) and design templates as Volusion does not offer many.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What this 3dcart alternative does offer though is a vast knowledge base that can help you with all kinds of questions, as well as guide you through the process of creating your perfect store. Just like other large ecommerce platforms, such as Shopify, this one comes with a large price tag. There are also a lot of add-on fees that can sum up to a considerable amount for small and startup businesses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Unlike most other 3dcart competitors, Virto Commerce is open source and offers all the tools and features needed to build a full-fledged web store. Virto Commerce is a great choice for B2B and enterprise ecommerce. This ecommerce solution is based on .NET 4.6 framework and uses cutting-edge technologies that give you all the freedom and flexibility you need when creating your website. Launch and scale your website using Microsoft cloud and market it with agile features.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><u><strong>Virto Commerce:&nbsp;</strong></u>With Virto Commerce as a 3dCart alternative, you will get access to flexible pricing models and a wide range of ecommerce integrations and functionality. Virto Commerce is by far the most flexible and customizable platform out there &ndash; and can&#39;t really be compared to off-the-shelf solutions like Shopify.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There is no universal ecommerce solution, but if you are looking for a .NET open source and scalable solution, that can grow with your business in the long run, consider Virto Commerce.&nbsp;</p>\n",
