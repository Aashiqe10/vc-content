        2016 has been a great year for B2B e-commerce, with the USA and China being the leaders in the industry and having sales reach over 1.2 billion dollars. Forrester suggests that the sales volume in B2B e-commerce will increase up to 1 trillion dollars within the next five years. With such a flourishing B2B e-commerce industry, countries like the USA and China are setting high standards and bringing certain major trends into play. The digital marketplace is a highly competitive environment, where each business has to either adopt the latest trends fast or simply let other companies take over the position of leadership. In this article, we would like to highlight the most prominent B2B ecommerce trends of 2016 and take a look at the ones that are going to be useful for your business and increase your sales in 2017.
    <h2>
    The B2B ECommerce Trends of 2016
    </h2>
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        <strong>Technology investments are set to grow.</strong> The latest development trends of B2B e-commerce marketplaces have made them a more favorable option for wholesalers, rather than retail stores. B2B companies have become robust and very adaptable to changes.  Let’s take the example of Virto Commerce e-commerce platform. It is very affordable and flexible to use. Investing in integration of platforms like this will allow your business to grow rapidly as well as give you the smoothest experience of expanding your outreach. 
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        <strong>B2B e-commerce has gone mobile.</strong> One of the biggest B2B eCommerce trends of 2016 is the accessibility of marketplaces on mobile platforms. M-commerce is accessible to its customers and is now becoming a fast-growing platform. It is easy to use; the client can access the platform anytime and from anywhere, and place orders on his product quickly. On top of that, it does not take a lot of resources to open a mobile app for a platform.  As recent Frankwatching research suggests, around 52% of B2B customers prefer to buy their products using their smartphones. It represents half of  all clients and is a huge number to deal with. To provide the best experience for your customers, you need to invest in mobile research and marketing heavily. This trend will most likely continue to evolve in 2017 as more and more purchasing decisions will be made through a mobile device.

    <p class="text">
        <strong>The customer experience is essential.</strong> The UX should be the primary focus for the retailers who sell their products at B2B marketplaces. Good UX helps with conversion of by passers on your web-store into loyal customers and promotes your website as one that is convenient to navigate. This B2B e-commerce trend plays a big role in differentiation and profitability, as buyers always demand for high-resolution product images, an exact description of the product, rich content, including many answers on F.A.Q.s, etc. Use your platform not only to sell products but to educate and inform buyers about the industry. 
    </p>
        <p class="text">
        <strong>Multichannel.</strong> There are two main sales models in the B2B industry. You may have your well-designed website and sell your product locally, but still not reach maximum profits. Allow your business to reach out to big platforms that connect thousands of manufacturers and are now becoming a vital place for the online presence for B2B sellers. Besides creating a responsive and perfectly-designed website, we highly recommend dedicating some time to Omni channeling your online presence as the marketplaces have become much more attractive to manufacturers, wholesalers, and distributors.

    <h2>
    B2B Ecommerce Trends in 2017
    </h2>
        <p class="text">
        Despite the fact that 2017 has just recently started, we can already point out some of the most prominent B2B eCommerce trends on the market. Following them is crucial in a rapidly-developing market, so let’s look into some of them. 
    </p>
    <div class="text" style="display: table; table-layout: fixed;">
        <div style="display: table-row;">
            <div style="display: table-cell; padding-right: 20px; width: 30%;">
                <img alt="Omni-channel customer care" src="assets/images/omni-channel.jpg" />
            </div>
            <div style="display: table-cell; vertical-align: top;">
                <strong>Omni-channel customer care.</strong> Following the trend of great customer experience that was present in 2016, omnichannel customer care has appeared. The customer service that was present only via e-mails is now totally unacceptable. B2B customers require even more attention than B2C ones and to provide that, websites need to have online customer service chats, the availability of web calls and focus on individual customer experience. This includes optimizing navigation for customer’s needs, adding search filters and other helpful perks. Smartly personalized B2B buying experience will be the way to go for the vendors.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="display: table; table-layout: fixed;">
        <div style="display: table-row;">
            <div style="display: table-cell; padding-right: 20px;">
                <strong>Video Marketing.</strong> Video content marketing strategy is gaining more and more prominence in the increasingly crowded B2B marketplace. It has become a standard for increasing audience of the websites and has played a great role in attracting and retaining customers.
            </div>
            <div style="display: table-cell; vertical-align: top; width: 30%;">
                <img alt="Video Marketing" src="assets/images/video-marketing.jpg" />
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="text" style="display: table; table-layout: fixed;">
        <div style="display: table-row;">
            <div style="display: table-cell; padding-right: 20px; width: 30%;">
                <img alt="Switching to open-source" src="assets/images/open-source.jpg" />
            </div>
            <div style="display: table-cell; vertical-align: top;">
                <strong>Switching to open-source.</strong> As all of the B2B e-commerce companies have to adapt to an ever-changing battlefield, making them open-source will most likely give them the out-of-the-box functionality and make them easier to configure and update. We can see this clearly with the example of Virto Commerce, which has recently become one of the prominent open-source platforms, serving various customers, ranging from wholesalers and distributors of complex products to those who sell only maintenance products.

    <div class="text" style="display: table; table-layout: fixed;">
        <div style="display: table-row;">
            <div style="display: table-cell; padding-right: 20px;">
                <strong>Focus on global markets.</strong> The most important thing for an owner of a B2B <a href="{{ '/glossary/ecommerce-platforms' | absolute_url }}">e-commerce platform</a> is to concentrate beyond his local area, beyond the existing customer base. In return for the risks that may appear, the business can gain millions of potential customers from the ever-growing Asian markets. This bold move may entail selling the products in local currencies, accepting local methods of payment, and provide an entirely different customer experience that is oriented towards a different culture, with different laws and government regulations.
