                    Abbreviated as DXP, a digital experience platform is an integrated software framework meant to engage a broad array of players in the broad array of digital touchpoints.
                    Most organizations deploy DXPs to improve their websites, portals, mobile applications, and other digital experiences. From this definition, DXPs may not be as
                    clear as you may want to understand them. However, organizations need one central platform responsible for controlling the wide span of its touchpoints.
                    This central platform for the expanded experience for an organization is the so-called digital experience platform.

                    <strong>Background of Digital Experience Platforms</strong>
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    The technology behind digital experience platforms has evolved over the years due to the increased venture of the digital space by both customers and workers.
                    The predecessor platforms that were DXP equivalents included CMS. A content management system is a basic system that was used to organize content, data, and
                    images for enterprises. Digital experience platforms soon took over due to the various challenges that CMS introduced, such as the introduction of silos in organizations.

                <div class="text">
                    WEM (Web Experience Management) came soon after. These were platforms that helped leverage the web technologies and also integrate them with the existing
                    enterprise systems. WEM brought about centralization, providing a better way of doing content management. These two early technologies gave rise to digital
                    experience platforms, which combined the power of WEM and the benefits of other open platforms to reduce the complexity of IT.

                    <strong>Why Does an Enterprise Need a DXP?</strong>
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    Enterprises will often come across customers’ need to have a single platform between their various platforms such as websites, apps, and even social media platforms.
                    They want content that is unified for both the internal and external experiences. Digital experience platforms are crucial in the ongoing transition from the
                    Web-oriented platforms to the digital platforms. Digital experience platforms offer comprehensive capabilities as they move from the Web-only platforms to the digital experiences.

                    <strong>Considerations to Make When Choosing a DXP</strong>
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    The critical question to ask yourself when selecting a digital experience platform is: Will the DXP put me on the path to better customer experience?
                    The first consideration you have to make is your enterprise’s technology stack or architecture. What technologies are you using to reach your customers?
                    If these questions are not clear to you, it is essential that you create a defined customer journey map. Doing this will help you know how to deliver digital
                    experiences to your customers best.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    After deciding on using a DXP, it is important that you measure its integrity. Let’s go through the integration standards of a digital experience platform briefly:
                    <ul class="text" style="margin-left:60px">
                        <li>Check whether the DXP is rationalized and integrated</li>
                        <li>Check whether it overlaps another product</li>
                        <li>Check its analytics and web content management to verify its integration</li>
                    </ul>
                    When choosing a digital experience platform, you should avoid ones that offer monolithic solutions. Make sure that it can be interpolated with any other platforms
                    that come next. It has to be flexible on the edges. The best digital experience platform is one that is open to future changes and can integrate even with other
                    third-party technologies.
