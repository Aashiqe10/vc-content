                    Abbreviated as DXP, a digital experience platform is an integrated software framework meant to engage a broad array of players in the broad array of digital touchpoints.
                    Most organizations deploy DXPs to improve their websites, portals, mobile applications, and other digital experiences. From this definition, DXPs may not be as
                    clear as you may want to understand them. However, organizations need one central platform responsible for controlling the wide span of its touchpoints.
                    This central platform for the expanded experience for an organization is the so-called digital experience platform.

                <div class="text">
                    The technology behind digital experience platforms has evolved over the years due to the increased venture of the digital space by both customers and workers.
                    The predecessor platforms that were DXP equivalents included CMS. A content management system is a basic system that was used to organize content, data, and
                    images for enterprises. Digital experience platforms soon took over due to the various challenges that CMS introduced, such as the introduction of silos in organizations.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    WEM (Web Experience Management) came soon after. These were platforms that helped leverage the web technologies and also integrate them with the existing
                    enterprise systems. WEM brought about centralization, providing a better way of doing content management. These two early technologies gave rise to digital
                    experience platforms, which combined the power of WEM and the benefits of other open platforms to reduce the complexity of IT.

                <h2 id="whyDoesAnEnterpriseANeedDXP">Why Does an Enterprise Need a DXP?</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    Enterprises will often come across customers’ need to have a single platform between their various platforms such as websites, apps, and even social media platforms.
                    They want content that is unified for both the internal and external experiences. Digital experience platforms are crucial in the ongoing transition from the
                    Web-oriented platforms to the digital platforms. Digital experience platforms offer comprehensive capabilities as they move from the Web-only platforms to the digital
                    experiences. The digital experience is critical to growing customer satisfaction and loyalty. Driven by the natural evolution of technology, a DXP can offer customers
                    the relevance that fulfils a specific need in a fully connected, digital experience. If your business is considering DXP, ask yourself these questions:
                </div>
                <strong id="isTheMajorityOfMyBusinessOnline">1. Is the majority of my business online?</strong>  
                <div class="text">                    
                    Whether you offer in-store or online experiences, DXPs enable customers to enjoy a fully connected experience with your business by leveraging any type of asset, or group of assets, across any digital touchpoint such as online, in-store, billboards, kiosks, customer portals, ecommerce systems, and more. The integrated software network engages disparate audiences across multiple, varying digital touchpoints and organizes omnichannel experiences.

                <div class="text">
                    If your organization has several “siloed” back-end systems that operate separately from one another with little to no connectivity, an agile DXP can improve the interaction between your customers and your brand.

                <strong id="howManyTouchpointsDoIHaveWithMyCustomers">3. How many touchpoints do I have with my customers?</strong>
                <div class="text">
                    Implementing a DXP is an extremely effective and efficient tool when you have a number of both in-store and digital touchpoints and a need to integrate backend and frontend systems to meet customer demand.
                </div>
                <strong id="isMyTargetAudienceDiverse">4. Is my target audience diverse?</strong>
                <div class="text">
                    A DXP is equipped to handle content and asset management on a large scale. This is an effective tool to segment your customer base and reach them exactly where and how they want to be reached.

                    <div class="text">The digital journey has evolved and is critical to customer retention. Sending the same message to every user does not equate to an exceptional, personalized user experience. With a DXP, your business can collect customer data, define personas, serve custom content to specific audiences, and connect with other channels such as social media or mobile applications. It integrates with other systems and departments to enable a highly personalized experience for customers.</div>

                    A DXP helps you build a meaningful relationship with all of your customers throughout the customer lifecycle. There are three distinct DXP options on the market today:

                    <div class="text">
                    Most marketing and advertising agencies that support B2C initiatives are unable to accelerate sales because they are limited by their current Content Management
                    Systems (CMS). The CMS DXP offers a wide variety of functions based on several customer-facing experiences to accelerate moving leads down the funnel in support
                    of sales.

                <h2 id="CMSAndDXPWhatsTheDifference">CMS and DXP - what’s the difference?</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    Supporting the online presence of your organization through a content management system is really important nowadays. Your company’s marketing, data and the entire
                    online identity of your brand – all of that and more is centered around a content management system. However, there is a difference between a content management
                    system (CMS) and a digital experience platform (DXP).
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    Let’s start from the beginning. CMS is the heart of a company’s website and subsequent applications. CMS also has all kinds of tools that a company needs for the
                    content delivery purposes, like workflow, administration, security and others.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    On the other hand, DXP is a platform capable of providing a plethora of tools and functions to help with delivering scalable and connectable personalized experience,
                    irrespective of the geographical location and language preferences.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    It’s true that CMS and DXP tend to overlap pretty often. However it’s still quite important for the decision makers to have at least some degree of understanding when
                    it comes to differences between these two.
                </div>
                <strong id="CMSAsADigitalHeart">CMS as a digital heart</strong>
                <div class="text">
                    As we’ve said, the bare minimum of CMS functionality is the ability to power both a website and subsequent applications of an organization. There’re also tools for
                    content delivering purposes – workflow, organizing, reporting, etc.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    However, it’s just a tip of the iceberg, really. Here’s the full list of features that CMS is capable of providing:
                </div>
                <ul class="text" style="padding-left:30px">
                    <li>
                        <i>Omnichannel.</i> Your customer experience shouldn’t get worse depending on what you client is using to access your website – shouldn’t matter if it’s desktop,
                        tablet, smartphone or something else entirely.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Content integrations and commerce.</i> Since in the current day content and commerce are pretty much inseparable – make sure that your CMS would provide you a
                        user-friendly interface that is capable of controlling both of those at the same time (inventory management, automated actions, testing capabilities, third-party
                        integrations and so on).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Managing a workflow.</i> A workflow needs to be adaptive to most of the situations that your business is facing on a daily basis – including editing, reporting,
                        promotion, approval, translation and so on.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Publishing.</i> Scheduling capabilities, as well as more basic edit and view features when it comes to data publication.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Performance and flexibility.</i> A modern CMS should be good at handling a lot of different tasks, from the most basic ones (organic growth over time) to
                        something more specific (quick creation of new campaigns and/or websites).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Compliance and protection.</i> Doesn’t matter if your main target is user authentication or data safety – you need to have good security, one way or another.
                        There are multiple regulations throughout the world, like GDPR when it comes to Europe, that have a lot of regulations when it comes to every company that is
                        operating within that regulation’s reach. That’s why one of the top requested features nowadays when it comes to CMSs is to have a strong security in the first
                        place, including data encryption capabilities, proficient PII (Personally Identifiable Information) compliance and a good level of integration with third-party
                        security providers, as well.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Multilinguality.</i> Bigger companies with larger reach are often working across different nations – this means multiple sites/languages support, as well as
                        translation, proper localization and compliance with local laws and regulations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <i>Cloud services.</i> Faster website and campaign deployment compared to more traditional methods, automating the update process, new features’ delivery with
                        impressive speed, etc.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="text">
                    On the first glance this might seem excessive to ask from a single CMS. At the same time, you can’t really survive on that market without striving to provide the most things with the best service. Especially since nowadays the division between marketing and technology becomes more blurred (there’s even a term for that now - martech) – sometimes it’s not exactly easy to see the distinction between two different tools.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    Actually, one of the points we’ve discussed – content integrations and commerce – is something that’s somewhat more than a simple CMS now, going into the DXP territory.
                </div>
                <strong id="CMSArchitecture">CMS architecture</strong>
                <div class="text">
                    Before moving on towards DXP, we’ll go over the base definition of CMS architecture – because this exact architecture determines the extent of your CMS’s capabilities.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    Usually, there are three common parts of a CMS as a software – a database as a content storage, a UI for web editing purposes and a programmable framework (Java,
                    ASP.NET or similar).
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    All three of those are hosted either in the cloud or within a web server. There are also different application layers in CMS as well – they define how all of the CMS
                    parts are interacting with each other and support the CMS in general.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    For example, if you want to get a certain content to your audience, the first ones to start working are content layer and delivery layer. Delivery layer is requesting
                    content from the content layer via a specialized programming interface called API (application programming interface). From the delivery layer that content then moves
                    to the presentation layer (sometimes called rendering layer), and the presentation layer is rendering delivered content on a screen.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    There are also different ways of storing content, as well. Without going into too much detail – while the basic way is to store content as the entire pages, there are
                    other ways of storing it using lesser parts of a page called either objects or items.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    The difference between those ways of storing data are quite simple, too. For once, it’s easier to reuse that content across apps and pages if that content is in items
                    or objects. A second reason is that there are no boundaries for it, like no specific page format, etc.
                </div>
                <strong id="DXPPersonalizedEngagementAndItsScaling">DXP: personalized engagement and its scaling</strong>
                <div class="text">
                    Our digital age has led to many discoveries and breakthroughs, but working today also means that your audience’s expectations would also be higher than before, too.
                    To adapt to those expectations many companies are changing in a big way, and within all of the different industries, from healthcare to manufacturing.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    The first difference between CMS and DXP is that, while CMS is capable of delivering and supporting the digital content in required amounts, DXP goes beyond that by
                    providing features like smart delivery across multiple sites, automation, and more. DXP is also capable of providing insight into the audience’s reception by
                    collecting and analyzing all of the data related to their interaction with said audience.
                </div>
                <div class="text">
                    One more way to look at it is this – DXP is a toolset that provides personalized digital experience across different channels. A well-suited DXP is capable of further
                    increasing your reach in both technology and marketing departments, including:
                </div>
                <ul class="text" style="padding-left:30px">
                    <li>
                        Lasting relationships with customers. It’s all about conversions – not everyone knows that a conversion is not the end but the new beginning. A DXP is capable of
                        in-depth tracking and analyzing engagements on a variety of levels.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Being omnichannel. There’s an enormous number of IoT devices in the world nowadays, and the voice-enablement is at its peak popularity – that’s why you should be
                        able to reach your audience through any means necessary, and a DXP is capable of doing that in one way or another.

                    Typically, a DXP’s core is still a CMS (it’s not necessary, CMS can be a part of a DXP in some other way, as well), but there’s a number of features that’s typically

                    DXP can be either a single-company solution or several solutions combined – it all depends on your specific needs. Since DXP are evolving as fast as the modern world
                    does, it’s quite unlikely to find a single solution that suits all of your needs. Most of the time you’ll need several products from one vendor, if not multiple
                    vendors to begin with.

                    At this point in the digital transformation of your business, you should create your eCommerce website and implement a DXP. The website is the foundation of your
                    future DXP system and one of its most active touchpoints. Next, determine the type of DXP that is right for you—CMS, Portal or Commercial—based on the size and scope
                    of your business and its touchpoints.

                <div class="text">
                    The critical question to ask yourself when selecting a digital experience platform is: Will the DXP put me on the path to better customer experience?
                    The first consideration you have to make is your enterprise’s technology stack or architecture. What technologies are you using to reach your customers?
                    If these questions are not clear to you, it is essential that you create a defined customer journey map. Doing this will help you know how to deliver digital
                    experiences to your customers best.

                <div class="text">
                    After deciding on using a DXP, it is important that you measure its integrity. Let’s go through the integration standards of a digital experience platform briefly:
                    <ul class="text" style="margin-left:30px">
                        <li>Check whether the DXP is rationalized and integrated</li>
                        <li>Check whether it overlaps another product</li>
                        <li>Check its analytics and web content management to verify its integration</li>
                    </ul>
                    When choosing a digital experience platform, you should avoid ones that offer monolithic solutions. Make sure that it can be interpolated with any other platforms
                    that come next. It has to be flexible on the edges. The best digital experience platform is one that is open to future changes and can integrate even with other
                    third-party technologies.

                    As evaluated, digital experience platforms go a step further than content management systems. Well, they do more than just creating an omnichannel customer
                    experience for an enterprise. But how exactly do they help in the growth of enterprises?

                    In addition to delivering various content through certain touchpoints, a Digital Experience Platform creates a singular point of view through the collection, unification and analysis of customer interaction data. Data unification leads to more effective decision-making as single workers or departments are able to share data. This overcomes the challenges of legacy Content Management Systems that are unable to interact with and transmit data to other siloed systems.

                    A DXP can also streamline employee performance by allowing everyone access to required information anytime they need it. This is especially useful by organizations that work with multiple languages or require their own created content to be translated into multiple languages.

                    At first glance, businesses may experience “sticker shock” over DXP’s initial price tag; however, the overall technology structure makes it a less expensive solution to maintain over time. The possibility to spread content to almost any IoT device that is able to receive it coupled with a headless CMS or an API-first CMS as a basis for a DXP makes it a lot easier to integrate into existing systems, manage updates or implement future systems.

From assisting with general processes of identifying the most logical action based on the current data and circumstances to generating precise individual insights, as is seen in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), AI can be useful in many situations. Investing in AI isn’t cheap, but brands can reap benefits in predictions that indicate the precise moment a customer is ready to buy or how to immediately meet a customer need.
