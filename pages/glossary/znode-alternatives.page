        "content": "<h3>Znode is an ecommerce platform that lets you easily build websites in various niches using a single database. If you have multiple web stores and pages to manage, Znode offers a great and comprehensible strategy through a single system.</h3>\n\n<p>This particular platform is 100% customizable due to its open source code. With this functionality, you can start selling and promoting with an unlimited amount of possibilities. It also supports marketing tools and branding. While creating websites for your products and services, brands, and stores, you&rsquo;ll be positively impressed with personalization options and functionality.</p>\n\n<p>Another major advantage of Znode is that you can easily increase conversion rates with its marketing functions and blogger-optimized software. The platform itself was built to handle heavy workload which makes it a good solution for enterprise-level businesses. Scalability also comes with the package allowing you to easily change the system as your business grows bigger.</p>\n\n<p>The downside of this platform is that it does not have secure transaction protocols in place and therefore can be susceptible to cyber-attacks and d-dos attacks. It also requires a lot of coding knowledge. Without it, you may not have access to the majority of its features. So, if you are not very tech savvy, you may want to consider a different ecommerce platform that still provides essential functionality while at the same time, doesn&rsquo;t send your head spinning with lots of complicated technology.&nbsp; If this is the case for you, here are some alternative solutions and Znode competitors.</p>\n",
