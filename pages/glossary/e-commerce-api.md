title: E-commerce API. Microservices e-commerce
description: E-commerce API is a concept that not everyone knows, and even fewer people know what API actually means to begin with. Understanding the nature of e-commerce API is incredibly important to be able to adapt to the modern market that is constantly changing and evolving.

                In today’s world, the rise of APIs in e-commerce is drastically changing the way the entire market operates. Yet not many people know what an API is to start with, let alone
                what an e-commerce API should do.

            <p class="text">
                Understanding what API is in general is recommended to understand it in the context of an e-commerce API. An true API – Application Program Interface – is a variety of tools,
                routines and protocols for building software-based applications. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                In general, the API is an interface that allows regular users to interact with the logic of the program without interacting with the actual code of the program in question,
                making the entire interaction process a lot less complex and more consumer friendly. At the same time, an e-commerce API is a set of e-commerce functions that can be
                accessed through this API. When we mention specific features, e-commerce API integration is generally represented by checkout, shopping cart, orders and payments (basically
                everything you need to make a transaction happen).
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                There may also be different types of APIs for e-commerce, and one of the most commonly used ones in e-commerce is Web APIs. Web APIs can be split into two main groups –
                public APIs and private APIs.
            </p>
            <h2 id="publicAndPrivateAPIs">Public and private APIs</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Public APIs are, surprisingly, only the small part of the whole range of APIs for e-commerce (even though public APIs are the most popular because they are used by everyone
                up to a few hundred times a day per person) – their purpose can be almost anything, such as a social network update, weather broadcast check, and so on.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Private APIs, on the other hand, are much more business-oriented, they are created for customers (paid customers mostly) by developers and their goals are partnerships,
                productivity and other e-commerce API design benefits.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Web APIs themselves can be further separated based on  the architecture, but we will not explain this in too much detail in this article. It will be enough to say that
                probably the most popular is REST (Representational State Transfer) – a set of principles that many developers follow in their work. There is also SOAP (Simple Object Access
                Protocol), JSON-RPC, XML-RPC and others, each with their own use cases, strengths and weaknesses.
            </p>
            <h2 id="itArchitectureTypes">IT architecture types</h2>
            <p class="text">
                Since we are now talking about architecture, time has come to say a few things about different IT architectures in the context of e-commerce API integration. Many e-commerce
                companies still use monolithic IT architectures that have many downsides and are usually inefficient in the modern world because they have problems with scaling, are
                generally chaotic and tend to overlap services inside, creating additional issues for all users.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                On the other hand, an architecture based on microservices uses both APIs and cloud technology advancements to solve monoliths in a number of services that are independent of
                each other and can go through the entire development cycle without interacting with each other, also creating a much better picture of a great company and a great API
                e-commerce platform.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                An example of a company that provides customers with microservices architecture is Virto Commerce. As an API e-commerce platform, Virto Commerce has its own modular
                architecture that makes it possible to select the level of granularity that the customer wants, allowing it to create both a microservices-based architecture and a
                monolithic one, just in case a company feels more comfortable with it. 
            </p>
            <h2 id="monolithicEcommerceArchitecture">Monolithic e-commerce architecture</h2>
            <p class="text">
                There are a number of reasons why the monolithic architecture is already outdated, as well as several reasons why the microservices e-commerce structure may be the best
                choice for e-commerce business. To begin with, let's look at the disadvantages of monolithic architecture:
            </p>
            <ul class="text" style="margin-left:30px">
                <li>
                    Complications. Since the entire system is huge and usually quite chaotic, it is difficult to find and solve all problems in time, because you never know if fixing one
                    problem will bring a few more into your system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scalability. Many e-commerce companies need to scale somehow and their IT systems need to grow with it. Unfortunately, monolithic architectures, as the name suggests,
                    can in principle not scale because they have a variety of interwoven modules with different requirements to start with.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Speed. This problem is somewhat similar to scalability, since the overall size and level of complications within monolithic architecture makes it extremely difficult to
                    "change course", so to speak. In that case, you may not react in time to a known market change or another drastic shift just because your IT structure is not versatile
                    enough.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Agility. The same goes for all kinds of experiments and innovations, it is an extremely difficult and slow process and changing something can bring unexpected risks to
                    your architecture in general.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="microservicesEcommerceArchitecture">Microservices e-commerce architecture</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/glossary/microservices-architecture.jpg" style="width:100%" />
            <p class="text">
                To emphasize the contrast, the explanation why micro-service-based architecture is a good choice today:
            </p>
            <ul class="text" style="margin-left:30px">
                <li>
                    Manageability. Each microservice can be managed and enhanced by a single group of developers or even outsourced to get started, reducing the overall costs for staffing
                    and creating a great e-commerce API design.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Resilience. A set of standards and overall simplicity helps your IT system to be much more stable than it would be in a chaotic combined state like with monolithic
                    architecture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scalability. Unlike the previous list, microservices are easily to scale up and down per demand, making it easy to change and adapt when needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Agility. Architecture based on microservices makes it easy to improve or experiment with most of your system without the risk of changing other parts of the architecture
                    in general.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">
                By rebuilding your architecture with microservices e-commerce in mind, you will find it much easier for your company to adapt to the ever-changing market, as well as making
                general experimentation about parts of your system a lot easier than before.
