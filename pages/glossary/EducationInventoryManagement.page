Order too much and you might be stuck with extra stock that you&#39;ll be forced to sell at a big discount or have it expire; all while paying extra carrying costs.</p>\n\n<p>One way to go about deciding on a reordering amount is to use information from previous months. In this case, you need to have the right inventory data at hand. A smart choice here would be to get a solution that will automatically track your inventory fluctuations. Even if you chose to go a slightly different route and use inventory forecasting software or even just Excel, you&#39;re still going to need inventory information from the previous months.</p>\n",

The larger the inventory you have, the more you&#39;ll be spending on storage, while increasing your risk of having products going out-of-date. Good news is there is an equation that helps you with this - the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) formula.</p>\n\n<p>Economic Order Quantity is a formula that helps calculate how many units your business should be adding to its inventory in order to reduce the total costs of inventory management &ndash; including factors like order costs, holding costs, and shortage costs. There are several EOQ calculators you can find online to assist in your calculations.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Ideally, you want your restock shipment to arrive when your previous batch is about to sell out. If it comes too early, you might face all kinds of storage and handling issues. And if it comes late, you&#39;re in danger of running out of stock. So, you want to make sure you always have enough products, which is where determining your reorder point gets important.</p>\n"
