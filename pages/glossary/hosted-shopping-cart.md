    <h2>Universal Features That Any Hosted Shopping Cart Platform Has to Have</h2>
    <div class="text">
        <p>Now that we have determined the benefits of using hosted shopping carts for growing your business, look at some of the core features that will allow you to sell your products on the Internet successfully.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Large and Functional Product Images.</strong> When buying any product online, a customer wants to have a look at it to discover its features and quality. Product images will allow you to do just that while also being one of the most effective ways of communication between you and your customer on the website. It has to be a “must have” for a shopping cart integration to allow you to upload high-resolution product images, and it is customers’ only opportunity to see the product and get impressed by it. Another important thing is that these pictures can be resized to your needs since the bigger (and the clearer) the image is the better. Look for the carts that give you the opportunity to have product zooming.</li>
            <li><strong>Product Review.</strong> Product reviews have shown their beneficial influence on the conversion rate as research suggest that more than 70% of Internet buyers, trust product reviews posted online. It is the reviews that help customers make the product choices, and to provide them with that, you have to look for a platform that allows you to include instant product reviews or at least has a way to implement some third-party product reviews programs.</li>
            <li><strong>Easy Navigation.</strong> Take care of your customers by offering them the layered navigation on you commerce website. Include some filtering options, so they can find exactly what they want. Make sure that the shopping cart will provide it for you by specifying that you need it to be data-driven and programmatic.</li>
            <li><strong>Fast and Easy Checkout.</strong> Checkout is the final moment of the purchase and you, as the owner have to go out of your way to make the checkout process painless to your customer.  Remember that clients always look for the shortest line and want to complete the final steps as fast as possible. To do that, you need to ensure that your checkout form has very few fields and is located on a single page. By doing this, you will promote the user-friendliness of the website and allow for better conversion rates.</li>
            <li><strong>Deals and Discounts.</strong> Deal shoppers love to use their coupons. With multiple services that can provide coupons, your website has to be adapted to receive them and promote special deals. Special deals along with the features we have previously highlighted will result in a pleasant customer experience and boost your sales in no time.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Having the must-have features covered, let’s move on to looking at the most widely-used shopping carts out there.</p>

            If you are striving for a perfect balance between the convenience of setting up and having the control over your website, then, <a href="{{ '/glossary/shopify-alternatives' | absolute_url }}">Shopify</a> is the best platform on the market. It is highly valued in the community for providing as much control as possible before opening your server. If you are a small business owner, the first thing you will notice about Shopify is their great support base, which offers you a great variety of tools to alter your store. Another great thing is the presence of their AppStore, where you can find useful plugins for creating and customizing your website. Despite all of its great features, Shopify lacks the content-marketing feature, which has become a big deal on the market. It is only with content marketing you can double your conversion rate thanks to customers becoming more educated about your products and therefore, more willing to buy it.
