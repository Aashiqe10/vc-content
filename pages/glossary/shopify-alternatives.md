    <p class="text">
    Shopify can be considered one of the best shopping cart platforms for an e-commerce website when it comes to balancing the convenience of setting up a website and having the control over it. The great advantage of this kind of electronic commerce platforms, including Shopify, is that they provide you with as much control as possible without you having to use your own server. If you are a small business owner, the first thing you will notice about Shopify is their great support base, which offers you a wide variety of tools to alter your store. The AppStore available for Shopify users can be useful in finding interesting plugins to customize your website.
    </p>  
    <p class="text">
    With its multitudes of features, like AppStore, cloud services, and good quality customer support, Shopify can get a little expensive, especially for a small business owner. In addition, the lack of any content-marketing features or blogging platforms makes it very hard to promote your product. Content-marketing opportunities have become a prominent requirement on the ecommerce market these days, however. With good content marketing, you can almost double your conversion rates, making your customers aware of your competitiveness and expertise in any given field. There are also other issues that may cause you to consider switching to one of the Shopify competitors. For example:
    </p>
    <p class="text">
    • Unnecessary transaction fees of up to 2% charged when you don’t use the built-in credit card processing service.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
    • The solution uses a different markup language which is called Liquid, which will take additional time to learn.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
    • If you don’t purchase advanced plans, you will lose the ability to utilize certain crucial e-commerce features.
    </p>
        <p class="text">
            While being a decent cost effective solution both for startups and big enterprises, it has some setbacks that can make you consider picking another ecommerce shopping cart software. One of the Shopify’s greatest achievement is adding an AppStore through which you can purchase some of the best features on the market. The only disadvantage of doing this is the fact that those apps are made by third-party developers, which bumps up the overall price of your websites and make you sacrifice your website’s the performance and overall speed. Besides that, there is no option to migrate all your data into another platform in case you have decided to switch to another one. Also, another feature that makes Shopify customers dissatisfied with it is its inability to add multi-language support to your website and one page checkout. The absence of these two things make it impossible for you to promote your product in other markets worldwide as well as increase your conversion rates. The basic plan which is $29 charges almost a 3%+30¢ fee for credit card payments and a 2% fee on top of that if you are using other external payment gateways. 
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Shopify plans are divided into three categories: Basic Shopify, Shopify, and Advanced Shopify. The Basic one has all of the necessary features you might need for creating your first web store. It comes at a price of $29 per month and offers you the unlimited file storage space as well as the ability to post the unlimited amount of products in the store. Standard Shopify plan starts at a price of $79 per month and comes with slightly decreased transactions fees, the ability to open more staff accounts and report and abandoned gift cart recovery features. For $299 per month, you can upgrade to an Advanced Shopify account which offers some of the features that will help you scale up your business. It brings a reduced transaction fees, bumps up the possible number of staff accounts to 15, enables you to use the advanced report builder feature and calculate shipping rates with third-parties. 
    </p>
        <p class="text">
    If you are not satisfied with your Shopify experience or just like to keep your options open, here are some of the best alternatives to Shopify that you should check out.
        </p>
