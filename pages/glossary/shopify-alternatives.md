    <p class="text">
    Shopify can be considered one of the best shopping cart platforms for an e-commerce website when it comes to balancing the convenience of setting up a website and having the control over it. The great advantage of this kind of electronic commerce platforms, including Shopify, is that they provide you with as much control as possible without you having to use your own server. If you are a small business owner, the first thing you will notice about Shopify is their great support base, which offers you a wide variety of tools to alter your store. The AppStore available for Shopify users can be useful in finding interesting plugins to customize your website.
    </p>  
    <p class="text">
    With its multitudes of features, like AppStore, cloud services, and good quality customer support, Shopify can get a little expensive, especially for a small business owner. In addition, the lack of any content-marketing features or blogging platforms makes it very hard to promote your product. Content-marketing opportunities have become a prominent requirement on the ecommerce market these days, however. With good content marketing, you can almost double your conversion rates, making your customers aware of your competitiveness and expertise in any given field. There are also other issues that may cause you to consider switching to one of the Shopify competitors. For example:
    </p>
    <p class="text">
    • Unnecessary transaction fees of up to 2% charged when you don’t use the built-in credit card processing service.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
    • The solution uses a different markup language which is called Liquid, which will take additional time to learn.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
    • If you don’t purchase advanced plans, you will lose the ability to utilize certain crucial e-commerce features.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
    If you are not satisfied with your Shopify experience or just like to keep your options open, here are some of the best alternatives to Shopify that you should check out.
