        "content": "<p>When choosing the right ecommerce platform for your enterprise business, you will not have the myriad of solutions available to small and midsize businesses &ndash; you will want to focus on evaluating a few platforms, including SAP Hybris and it&#39;s competitors: Salesforce Commerce Cloud, Shopify, Magento and Virto Commerce. As B2B ecommerce experts, we get a lot of questions from customers trying to evaluate SAP Hybris vs Magento vs other B2B ecommerce platforms. We will look at SAP Hybris and one of it&#39;s main alternatives, Magento, as well as Virto Commerce &ndash; a rapidly growing B2B ecommerce platform utilized by Heineken, Volvo, Rainbow Sandals and a variety of enterprise businesses.</p>\n\n<p>SAP Commerce Cloud (recently rebranded from SAP Hybris) is one of the most well-known cloud ecommerce platforms available. Around since the 1990s, the platform helped usher in the big dotcom boom of the early 2000s.</p>\n\n<p>Since its inception, it has evolved into a highly agile ecommerce platform for both B2B and B2C selling, with modules and accelerators that have been developed for specific industries like grocery, education, insurance and apparel.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to these plug and use modules that can customize the platform for specific industries, it can also be integrated with other SAP Cloud platforms for a seamless ecommerce process from the front to back ends.</p>\n\n<p>SAP Commerce Cloud can be used by non-tech savvy ecommerce store owners, as it comes with many ready-to-use templates for common ecommerce functions, including promotions. It is highly customizable, integrates well with other services and is scalable to handle large shopping days.</p>\n",

        "content": "<p>As good as SAP Commerce Cloud is, the platform does have some drawbacks. Most notably, since it uses some older functionality, it could stand for an update to its Content Management System and some of the aforementioned modules. While you don&#39;t need to be tech savvy to use the platform, those who are will be able to get better use out of it.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike platforms that have the value of being open source, SAP Hybris is a closed platform. It&#39;s not flexible and easy to customize &ndash; greatly limiting your business. With the rapid pace of ecommerce change, using a platform that doesn&#39;t offer agility and extensibility could prove to be an expensive mistake in the long run, as replatforming or changing your SAP Commerce Cloud solution is quite pricey and time consuming.</p>\n\n<p>The out-of-the-box promotion templates are useful, but if you can&#39;t find one that fits your exact needs, customizing them will require more advanced technical knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>If you are a small operation and you don&#39;t have a dedicated IT team, SAP Commerce Cloud could pose a problem since it doesn&#39;t have the comprehensive support and guidance that other platforms on the market offer.</p>\n",
