        "content": "<p>A punch out catalog is an e-procurement solution that provides access to the supplier&#39;s catalog from the vendor&#39;s website interface. In other words, a customer &quot;punches out&quot; a procurement application to the original site, gets access to the supplier&#39;s catalog, and can then add items to a shopping cart.</p>\n\n<p>With a punchout catalog,&nbsp;the supplier does not receive an order when a customer makes a purchase. Instead, all items from the shopping cart are processed within the buyer&#39;s e-procurement system. The customer might not even notice that he had entered another site&#39;s catalogue.</p>\n\n<p>In more technical terms, a punchout catalog is an online vendor catalog that has been enhanced via an open catalog interface to support PunchOut Procurement associated with a PunchOut website. The punchout ecommerce solution enables the direct connection between ERP or an e-procurement system of the buyer and the storefront of the supplier. A punchout catalogue is a convenient way for customers to browse suppliers&#39; catalogues and place orders from within their existing e-procurement system.&nbsp; Punchout catalogs are essential in conducting efficient ecommerce.&nbsp;</p>\n",

When a customer leaves the buyer&#39;s site, the punchout sends the login request and connects the buyer&#39;s and supplier&#39;s systems. The storefront displays items, prices, description, purchase terms, and other information, so the customers can add the requested items to their shopping cart. Then the cart is brought back to the buyer&#39;s e-procurement system as a requisition and is processed using the company&#39;s standard system workflow steps and financial approvals. The order is sent to the supplier after the purchase has been approved by the buyer.</p>\n"
