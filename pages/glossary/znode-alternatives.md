    Znode is an ecommerce platform that lets you easily build websites in various niches using a single database. If you have multiple web stores and pages to manage, Znode offers a great and comprehensible strategy through a single system. 
    </p>  
    <p class="text">
    This particular platform is 100% customizable due to its open source code. With this functionality, you can start selling and promoting with an unlimited amount of possibilities. It also supports marketing tools and branding.  While creating websites for your products and services, brands, and stores, you’ll be positively impressed with personalization options and functionality. 
    </p>
    <p class="text">
    Another major advantage of Znode is that you can easily increase conversion rates with its marketing functions and blogger-optimized software. The platform itself was built to handle heavy workload which makes it a good solution for enterprise-level businesses. Scalability also comes with the package allowing you to easily change the system as your business grows bigger. 
    </p>
    <p class="text">
    The downside of this platform is that it does not have secure transaction protocols in place and therefore can be susceptible to cyber-attacks and d-dos attacks. 
    </p>
    <p class="text">
    It also requires a lot of coding knowledge. Without it, you may not have access to the majority of its features. So, if you are not very tech savvy, you may want to consider a different ecommerce platform that still provides essential functionality while at the same time, doesn’t send your head spinning with lots of complicated technology. 
    </p>
    <p class="text">
    If this is the case for you, here are some alternative solutions and Znode competitors.
    </p>

        </div>
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            This Znode alternative is great for creating full-featured web stores that will suit your business needs. <a href="https://www.bigcartel.com/" rel="nofollow">The platform</a> is good for small businesses and enterprise level companies alike.

    <h2>Send Owl</h2>
    <div class="col-w">
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-right: 20px;">
           If you already have a website, you can use this alternative to Znode to embed a web store into it. There is no need to build a full-fledged online store, just make product pages. This is the simplest way of creating an ecommerce store. There isn’t any switching required, you can easily change and vary the design of your pages. 
           This is the <a href="https://www.sendowl.com/" rel="nofollow">best platform</a> for small stores that don’t have many products to put up. Basic plans start at $9 per month and allow you to post up to 10 products.

        </div>
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            This is also an outstanding platform among znode alternatives that will give you a chance to embed a web store into an existing website. This platform provides you with the maximum freedom and can be almost considered a full-on ecommerce store. Adding product listings, managing products and setting prices haven’t been any easier than that.  
            The templates are robust and the platform creates the design for you. Publish your store in social networks and add it to your personal blog or website. The store will be clearly organized in categories with a search tool attached making it easy to explore the store’s options.

           <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/en" rel="nofollow">PrestaShop</a> is a hosted shopping cart solution that gives you an opportunity to launch an ecommerce store and have it hosted by the platform itself. 
           The best thing about it is its openness. The app is completely free and lets you use the vast variety of tools in the cloud, as well as on your local servers. 
           You can easily add popovers for customers to see your product options and browse through all of them in no time. It also comes with the filtered search option and email marketing possibilities that also provide detailed statistics about your website’s visitors and consumers.            
          The platform allows you to manage multiple storefronts with a single account. And if you’re not satisfied with the available design templates (which are in fairness pretty limited), consider purchasing more from the store.
