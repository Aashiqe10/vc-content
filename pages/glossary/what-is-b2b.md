        <h1> What is b2b </h1>
        <p class="text">
          In order to understand what B2B is in reality, imagine a complex network of cross-company transactions and supply chains that stand behind the range of goods in a supermarket. Every purchase is supported by B2B sales.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
           B2B (business 2 business) is focused on sales of products, services, or information to other businesses, and stands in contrast to B2C (business to consumer) and B2G (business to government) models. All these marketing principles involve the same basics, but B2B relies mostly on valuable and robust business relationships to guarantee long-term involved customers. Among the success factors of the B2B leaders are effective account management team, good process optimization and benefits from technological innovations.
        </p>
        <h2>What is a B2B company?</h2>
        <p class="text">
            A B2B company is essentially a business relationship manufacturer and a wholesaler, or a wholesaler and a retailer. A supply chain usually involves more than two companies. Such goods as plastic, grain, or chemicals don't always have a practical use for consumers, but are important for wholesale distribution, which is the base of the business-2-business model. Products and resources may be provided from a number of suppliers; and careful planning is vital to performing-efficient transactions, considering complex integration schemes.
        </p>
        <h2>What is B2B ecommerce?</h2>
        <p class="text">
           The Internet allows companies to increase their prospect pool. Loud online presence grants access to many more potential consumers and partners than traditional advertising models. According to statistics, over 90% of product researches on B2B level start with search engines. So, the Internet becomes an essential trade channel.
        </p>
         <p class="text">
           A company would make great digital marketing efforts to evolve into a strong brand. There are many articles and training courses dedicated to online promotion and SEO, but all efforts would be in vain, if a prospective partner leaves the page in a few minutes, because the website itself is “inconvenient”. If a visitor is confused from the first minute of being on the website, all other benefits - a company offers may fade from the view.
        </p>
         <p class="text">
           B2B ecommerce is an online business model with flexible enterprise software as a ground solution for purchasing, selling and promoting services, information, or products.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            In B2B ecommerce examples the ecommerce technology can become a critical success factor. The website must represent your business well, be user-friendly, and allow prospective buyers to get the information they've been searching for. This raises a question about the right choice of software.
        </p>
        <h2>What is B2B software?</h2>
        <p class="text">
            A B2B ecommerce solution must meet the following requirements:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Scalability</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="text">
            As popularity of your website increases and as your business evolves, it can become hard to scale it with minimal effort and to avoid proportional growing of infrastructure management costs. Progressive ideas, new trading partners’ joining, services expansion, integrating your other systems and channels are all good reasons to level up. The optimal ecommerce solution must be equipped with scalable software architecture and a powerful, flexible engine able to conform to ongoing integration. A platform with strong API can be integrated much easier than an outdated solution.
        </p>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>Flexibility</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="text">
           When evaluating ecommerce applications, the flexibility of a solution is important. It will allow you to customize it for the unique needs of your B2B company. A highly integrated B2B solution is envolved with many systems and processes. While putting continued emphasis on business evolution, a company should look for modularity of the platform base, which must be focused on fitting your unique business processes, while being configurable for a clean and easy integration at the same time.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
           An out-of-the-box solution allows you to not start from scratch. But super-structuring templates can only be a temporary solution. An open source ecommerce software gives you the flexibility to design, customize and be truly creative while configuring your B2B website.
        </p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>Reliability</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="text">
           The solution should be secure and robust. This factor applies to both inner company security and client data security. Things like personal data protection and PCI compliance are must-have options for ecommerce sellers to safeguard their customers' information. An ecommerce management system must accentuate roles and permissions.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            Among other common demands is data hosting.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          The difference between cloud-based and on-premise hosting affects many areas of ecommerce platform, such as maintenance, costs, customization, and security. An on-premise solution means the control is fully yours. But with it comes server maintenance and fixing upcoming issues. Cloud-based hosting provides cost-efficiency and scalability, as well as secure connection between multiple B2B partners. It's trendy to claim that the future is in the cloud. But the level of control that comes with on-premise hosting can be worth the added responsibilities. It's ultimately up to you to see which solution works better for your company’s security demands.
        </p>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>Usability and transparency</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="text">
           Information management and promoting product usability are the key components of B2B marketing campaigns. An ecommerce software should provide a promotion service engine with powerful and easy to use tools to optimize your offers and drive conversions, as well as intuitive controls that can be used without in-depth training. Clear ticketing system, simple event and campaign creation, optimized content management and rapid order management are the groundwork for an online store. Stats tracking and reporting allow you to have an insight into the running of your B2B businesses online and to drive specific campaigns. You can’t control what you can’t measure. The monitoring of business metrics must be detailed and easily accessible.
