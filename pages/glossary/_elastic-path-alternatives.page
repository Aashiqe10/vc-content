This solution does not require installation of enormous amounts of plugins.&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>Despite the enormous range of features provided, its open source code can be a downside for some users. Most business owners are not that tech savvy, so they might have a hard time working with the source code. Its lack of blogging software that is becoming more and more common across all solutions can also be a challenge. If this is a critical feature for your business, you might have to install another platform for content management, thus reducing the response speed of the website. All of these issues might cause you to look for an elastic path alternative.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>There are many alternatives to Elastic Path - a few are listed below.</p>\n",

This Elasticpath alternative is a cloud based SaaS platform, meaning you wouldn&#39;t have to worry about maintaining its infrastructure. With its vast template library you can easily build an eye-catching website and implement the best UX practices within it.&nbsp;<br />\nOne negative about this alternative to Elasticpath is its human resource requirements, meaning you need to hire a professional programmer. However, you are looking for an enterprise solution and have the development power and resources to manage Commerce Cloud&#39;s top features and practices, it&#39;s worth a look.&nbsp;</p>\n"

The web store requires almost no technical experience, as Ecwid&#39;s builder is intuitive. It also entitles you to use a large amount of built in tools to design your perfect shopping cart, but lacks the flexibility of open source solutions. Ecwid is more appropriate for a small business just getting started online.&nbsp;</p>\n"

Virto Commerce offers an open source solution, however, there will be no stress involved for a person who is not all that familiar with coding. Thanks to cutting edge .NET 4.6 framework and technologies like Angular and Liquid on which the platform is built upon, it provides easy set-up and operation. You will be able to build your website in no time and start selling quickly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Virto Commerce can be used by any kind of business, any size. Both for startups or enterprise-level companies, Virto Commerce will provide the necessary functionality and some value-added features to empower your digital transformation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The simplicity of the platform&#39;s user interface and its agile technologies will allow you to market your business quickly and easily. After creating your store, you can deploy it using the leading reliable and secure Microsoft Cloud and scale it with sophisticated multi-channel solutions that other Elastic Path alternatives lack.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Its flexible pricing lets you save funds for other parts of your business.
