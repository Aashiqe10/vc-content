        "content": "<p>Shopify is a great shopping cart platform for an ecommerce website as it&#39;s easy to set up a site and have control over it. An advantage of out of the box commerce platforms, like Shopify, as well as several alternatives to Shopify, is control over design of your site without having to use your own server. For small business owners, you will notice Shopify offers you a wide variety of tools to alter your store. The AppStore available for its users contains many interesting plugins to customize your website.<br />\n<br />\nHowever, despite all it&#39;s features, Shopify is expensive especially for a small business owner. Additionally, the lack of content marketing features make it hard to promote your product. Content marketing opportunities are key for choosing a digital commerce provider, as marketing powers revenue growth. There are also other issues that may cause you to consider switching to a Shopify competitor, as today&#39;s Shopify alternatives might satisfy your needs.&nbsp;</p>\n",

Magento is suitable for large corporations with sufficient funds to hire programmers, as Magento requires a lot of coding. For enterprises, Magento is a viable Shopify alternative.&nbsp; Smaller companies should consider other Shopify competitors which are more appropriate for small business.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Pros</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Probably its most well known feature is its flexibility. Being open source, that means anyone using it can go into the source code and tinker with it for complete customization. It also allows for easy third party integration.</li>\n\t<li>Its large user community means you can find support for issues you have quite easily online, plus they are always developing useful plugins for it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>By far the biggest con of this Shopify competitor&nbsp;is its price. While the community version of it is free and can be used for small businesses, mid-tier businesses and larger enterprises have to shell out upwards of $20,000 per year according to some sources.</li>\n\t<li>While the platform does have a huge user base and a lot of people who like to tinker with it, true Magento developers -- meaning ones who completely know what they are doing -- are hard to find and are likely going to be expensive.</li>\n\t<li>Magento is going to be daunting for people who are not at least a little tech savvy, so if you don&#39;t have a dedicated IT team, this may not be the best platform to use. The loading times for the free version can be slow and hosting can be an issue (although Magento does offer cloud hosting).&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n",

The only reason why BigCommerce is falling behind Shopify on popularity is its limited set of features and design templates.

Plans come with unlimited products, file storage and staff accounts.</li>\n\t<li>Users can sell in places other than their store with easy integration with other platforms like eBay and Amazon, and also social media platforms.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Cons</strong><br />\nThe biggest con with BigCommerce is its complex pricing options that seem to punish stores the more successful they are. Each pricing option has a limit as to how much annual revenue is allowed with that option. If you go over the allotted revenue amount, you will automatically be bumped up to the next pricing level, so stores with over $125,000 in annual revenue should look at platforms designed for enterprise. Additionally, the theme editor can be a bit clunky to use until you get the hang of it.</p>\n",

It is an open source WordPress shopping cart plugin that can be installed for free and used along with any WordPress account. Woocommerce can easily turn your website into a feature-packed web shop. With this alternative to the other Shopify competitors, you do not have to worry about being charged with any credit card transaction fees. Taking into an account that both alternatives to Shopify are free, the store can be hosted anywhere after you install WordPress. Take into a consideration that you will have to purchase a separate hosting subscription and this may take some money from your pocket. Having a website hosted on the other platform may involve you knowing some technical skills.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, you can expand WooCommerce&rsquo;s functionality by downloading more extensions and add-ons. The only thing you have to keep in mind as far as pricing, you will sometimes have to pay for those add ons as well as for your WordPress hosting. Other than that, WooCommerce is valued among its users for seamless WordPress integration, absence of monthly service charge, ability to create a responsive, mobile friendly website, and for it having a developer- friendly environment that increases the productivity.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have set up your basic store with the plugin, it would be beneficial to purchase some advanced feature packages to it. There are two prominent packages that you might want to consider. The first is Product Bundles, which can be used to increase the sales of your store. The feature comes at a price of $49 and gives you the option to bundle multiple products of yours for sale and enhance the sales on your website. The second add-on is WooCommerce Freshdesk which costs $79 and enables you to provide customer support for the visitors of your store by being able to receive and handle support tickets. Woocommerce plugins come in all shapes and sizes for you to increase the productivity of you web shop.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, if you have a business which is already running on a WordPress platform, you can quickly integrate this plugin into an existing website. Enjoy the freedom and flexibility even more by not disclosing any of your data with third-party software platforms and by doing only a single payment for any add-ons you will possibly install (compare to Shopify&rsquo;s monthly subscription feature).</p>\n",

If you would like to have a solution that will give you control over every single aspect of your website, while not demanding high technical knowledge, you have just found the right one. With around the same price as Shopify, this tool will allow you to open unlimited amount of admin accounts for managing your stores, will provide you with ability to upload unlimited product images and get a real-time shipping quotes with shipping tracking features.</p>\n\n<p>Pinnacle Cart can be considered one of the&nbsp;easiest platforms to use for building a custom eCommerce website. You can easily choose from 30 free templates offered to you, or order a customized one from the company. While the templates are sufficient in their design, you are free to edit HTML or CSS to edit them or specify the layout of your products. This platform, as one of Shopify competitors, can offer you a domain and even integrate it with WordPress. Over 30 payment gateways are available to connect. Guest and PayPal checkout options are allowed and can be integrated into the mobile version, which makes it easier for customers to buy your product. For more advanced plans, you will get fraud protection with a dedicated SSL certificate which will deliver a great protection to your website and payment gateways. Customer support is a priority of PinnacleCart, with 24/7 customer support on the phone and online text. With that, online knowledge base is also available to you to help you in your ecommerce journey. The store, however, does not offer custom store email which can seem as a drawback.</p>\n\n<p>You can feel this particular shopping cart well-suited for you if you would like to have a great variety of features out of the box, and therefore, not lose a lot of website speed by burdening your store with lots of plugins (compare to Shopify, where you have to install multiple add ons to have these features). Another great advantage of Pinnacle cart is its absence of any credit card transaction fees with the competitive rate pricing.</p>\n",
