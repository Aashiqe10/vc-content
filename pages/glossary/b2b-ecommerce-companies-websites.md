        <p class="text">
          With the advancement of internet, information technologies, digital systems, and standards of their interaction, the new way of doing business has evolved. E-business is a unique form of doing business that is executed by implementing information technologies in the process of production, trading, and distribution of goods and services. It is becoming more and more popular for companies to go online in all of the areas of business, including B2B commerce. When we mention B2B, the first thing that comes to mind is e-commerce systems – software and websites, which become tools for purchasing products and goods for businesses via the Internet. 
        </p>
        <p class="text">
           Nowadays, B2B e-commerce sites keep gaining popularity. Using business-to-business e-commerce sites (or b2b portals) is becoming more favorable for B2B e commerce companies that do not want to deal with expensive and complicated EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) data exchange systems. The most important thing for them is to connect with small suppliers. When using business to business e-commerce websites, small businesses have a chance to compete with the larger companies. B2B <a href="/glossary/ecommerce-platforms">platforms</a> are valued for their usability and include various solutions for the suppliers, as well as for the customers. 
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            There has been a drastic shift in the e-commerce from B2C (business to consumer) to B2B. B2B e-commerce sites are more complex and contain way more features than B2C. In this article, we would like to present you the top B2B e commerce sites.
        </p>
        <h2>What is the focus of top B2B e commerce sites?</h2>
        <img alt="B2B e commerce companies and websites" src="assets/images/what-is-b2b-ecommerce.jpg"></img>
        <p class="text">
            While compiling this list, we focused on several features, which every B2B e-commerce company and portal should have.
        </p>
        <p class="text">1. Complex pricing options. B2B e commerce companies often offer different prices for different business partners.</p>
        <p class="text">2. Flexible checkout process and delivery. The checkout process should always match your company’s regulations for payment and shipping.</p>
        <p class="text">3. Navigation and search. User experience is critical in evaluating the quality of an e-commerce website. Every buyer has to be able to easily find what he needs and be done with placing the order as quickly as possible. It is also crucial for every B2B e-commerce company to have a relevant and high-quality site search.</p>
        <p class="text">4. Customer registration. B2B sites usually require mandatory registration to provide their customers with the custom products, special prices, and deals.</p>
       <p class="text">5. Mobile commerce and e-mail marketing newsletter. The website should be accessible for mobile users and interact with its buyers on a day-to-day basis via e-mail newsletters.</p>
      <p class="text">6. Certified e-commerce trust marks that prove the website's reliability when it comes to purchasing goods and services.</p>
        <h2>10 revolutionary B2B e-commerce sites</h2>
        <p class="text">
           Using our personal experience and the E-consultancy blog reviews, we have compiled a list of top 10 B2B portals, who provide inspiration and have truly been revolutionary and innovative. 
        </p>
        <h3>Alibaba</h3>
        <img alt="Alibaba B2B ecommerce site" src="assets/images/Alibaba.png"></img>
         <p class="text">
           The e-commerce company based in China and launched in 1999. It is currently the world’s largest global e-commerce platform for small businesses. More than 18 million buyers and sellers from around 240 countries and regions use this platform. It showcases a great variety of products in more than 40 industry categories ranging from raw materials to finished goods. Alibaba Group does not sell products and services directly. Instead, it offers a platform that connects B2B sellers and buyers from around the world. The huge benefit of Alibaba is that it is free to join, as it makes most of its profits via commissions and advertising. Being a seller, you can display up to 50 products/services with no fee, and with the Gold membership, you get a mini- website to display the unlimited amount of goods or services. As a buyer, the only thing that you need to do is “Request a Quote” and let sellers come to you. We consider Alibaba to be the go-to English-language platform for cross-border trade and for expanding to overseas markets. 
        </p>
        <h3>Made-in-China.com</h3>
        <img alt="Made-in-China B2B e commerce company" src="assets/images/madeinChina.png"></img>
         <p class="text">
           This portal is the important member of top 10 b2b portals. It was founded and is now operated by Focus Technology. The website is a great way of connecting Chinese suppliers with buyers from around the world. It provides accessible web-based solutions to small and medium enterprises.

The platform serves as a connection bridge between Chinese manufacturers and International Buyers. The marketplace is available in Europe and the U.S. and allows buyers to connect with high-quality Chinese suppliers in minutes. One prominent feature of the website is its Reports feature. It provides valuable information about the vendor, including business license, manufacturing capabilities, and quality control systems. All manufacturers can add products, as well as search for buyers, importers or requests-to-buy on the offer board.
