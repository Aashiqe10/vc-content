Traditionally, companies used to get on premise ecommerce solutions. They would obtain an enterprise software license, then install and maintain the required hardware and software within their own or controlled physical location. The biggest advantage of this solution is full control over everything that has to do with the company&#39;s ecommerce system down to every physical server and every software tweak. The downside is that your company will be the one responsible for setting up and constantly maintaining the hardware (and carrying all the costs associated with it) and re-calibrating all the software customizations every time there is an update.</p>\n\n<p>SaaS ecommerce solutions, on the other hand, are owned, maintained and managed remotely by the software provider. The provider will deliver your ecommerce SaaS software and take care of updating it on a regular basis, as well as maintaining the hardware infrastructure. The solution will be available to you and accessible from anywhere by simply logging in online and financed on a pay-as-you-go or a subscription basis based on use metrics.</p>\n",

Pricing is competitive when compared to other platforms, and does not include any transaction fees regardless of the payment gateway used. Plans come with unlimited products, file storage and staff accounts. Additionally, users can sell in places other than their store with easy integration with other platforms like eBay and Amazon, and also social media platforms.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The biggest con with BigCommerce is its complex pricing options that seem to punish stores the more successful they are. Each pricing option has a limit as to how much annual revenue is allowed with that option. If you go over the allotted revenue amount, you will automatically be bumped up to the next pricing level, so stores with over $125,000 in annual revenue should look at platforms designed for enterprise. Additionally, the theme editor can be a bit clunky to use until you get the hang of it.</p>\n"
