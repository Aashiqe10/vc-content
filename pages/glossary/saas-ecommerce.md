    <h2>What is SAAS Platform?</h2>
    <p class="text">
    Software as a Service or SAAS is a way of delivering services over the Internet. In particular, providing hosted applications. All of the SAAS applications run on a provider’s servers. SAAS platforms allow you to avoid having to install and download the sophisticated software and free you from concerns about security and performance of your website.
    </p>  
    <p class="text">
    SAAS ecommerce platforms offer the fastest way of launching your online store while at the same time, saving your website’s design and development budget. SAAS Content Management Systems (SAAS CMS) offer the ideal solution for launching your online business. These applications have long proven themselves to be useful website builders. Small and medium-sized businesses alike are continuing to utilize them and enjoy their large variability and customizability. These days SAAS solutions are the way to go, so it’s always helpful to expand your knowledge about SAAS e-commerce. Virto Commerce has proven itself to be the best SAAS solution on the market, reading further you’ll see why.

    <h2>Why is SAAS platform best suited for your business?</h2>
    <p class="text">
    SAAS has become hugely popular among business owners. At least 40% of online stores are based on SAAS ecommerce solutions, and 90% of all the stores use at least some form of SAAS service. First of all, by using SAAS, you do not need to buy expensive software. Second of all, there is no coding experience required. All of the website building is based on “drag and drop” operations. You get a whole set of functionalities with the ability to get the perfect site, specifically crafted for your needs. Also, e-commerce SAAS platforms like Intershop, <a href="{{ '/glossary/magento-alternatives' | absolute_url }}">Magento</a>, and <a href="{{ '/glossary/3dcart-alternatives' | absolute_url }}">3dcart</a> are very scalable and can be easily adapted to any user’s needs by offering a good amount of different applications, extensions, and plug-ins. Moreover, cloud-based SAAS platform provides an easy way to connect to a single database that will hold any of the relevant website information. Lastly, you will always be able to enjoy working on your site by accessing your platform from any device imaginable without painful additional software installations.</p>
     <h2>SAAS vs. on-premise (fully customizable) platforms</h2>
    <p class="text">
        There are certain pros and cons to each solution. In the end, it all comes down to what works best for your particular business.</p>
    <p class="text">
        Traditionally, companies used to get on premise ecommerce solutions. They would obtain the enterprise software license, then install and maintain the required hardware and software within their own or controlled physical location. The biggest advantage of this solution is full control over everything that has to do with the company’s ecommerce system down to every physical server and every software tweak. The downside is that your company will be the one responsible for setting up and constantly maintaining the hardware (and carrying all the costs associated with it) and re-calibrating all the software customizations every time there is an update. </p>
    <p class="text">
        SaaS ecommerce solution, on the other hand, is going to be owned, maintained and managed remotely by the software provider. The provider will deliver your ecommerce SaaS software and take care of updating it on a regular basis, as well as maintaining the hardware infrastructure. The solution will be available to you and accessible from anywhere by simply logging in online and financed on a pay-as-you-go or a subscription basis based on use metrics.</p>
