As B2B ecommerce experts, we get a lot of questions from customers trying to evaluate SAP Hybris vs Magento vs other B2B ecommerce platforms. We will look at SAP Hybris and one of it&#39;s main alternatives, Magento, as well as Virto Commerce &ndash; a rapidly growing B2B ecommerce platform utilized by Heineken, Volvo, Rainbow Sandals and a variety of enterprise businesses.</h3>\n\n<p>SAP Commerce Cloud (recently rebranded from SAP Hybris) is one of the most well-known cloud ecommerce platforms available. Around since the 1990s, the platform helped usher in the big dotcom boom of the early 2000s.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nSince its inception, it has evolved into a highly agile ecommerce platform for both B2B and B2C selling, with modules and accelerators that have been developed for specific industries like grocery, education, insurance and apparel.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nIn addition to these plug and use modules that can customize the platform for specific industries, it can also be integrated with other SAP Cloud platforms for a seamless ecommerce process from the front to back ends.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nSAP Commerce Cloud can be used by non-tech savvy ecommerce store owners, as it comes with many ready-to-use templates for common ecommerce functions, including promotions. It is highly customizable, integrates well with other services and is scalable to handle large shopping days.&nbsp;</p>\n",

        "content": "<p>As good as SAP Commerce Cloud is, the platform does have some drawbacks. Most notably, since it uses some older functionality, it could stand for an update to its Content Management System and some of the aforementioned modules. While you don&#39;t need to be tech savvy to use the platform, those who are will be able to get better use out of it.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nUnlike platforms that have the value of being open source, SAP Hybris is a closed platform. It&#39;s not flexible and easy to customize &ndash; greatly limiting your business. With the rapid pace of ecommerce change, using a platform that doesn&#39;t offer agility and extensibility could prove to be an expensive mistake in the long run, as replatforming or changing your SAP Commerce Cloud solution is quite pricey and time consuming.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe out-of-the-box promotion templates are useful, but if you can&#39;t find one that fits your exact needs, customizing them will require more advanced technical knowledge.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nIf you are a small operation and you don&#39;t have a dedicated IT team, SAP Commerce Cloud could pose a problem since it doesn&#39;t have the comprehensive support and guidance that other platforms on the market offer.&nbsp;</p>\n",

        "content": "<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">There are myriad alternatives for B2B ecommerce platforms. We will look at the positives and negatives of top SAP Hybris competitors that you may consider:</h3>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><u><strong>Virto Commerce</strong></u></h3>\n\n<p>Virto Commerce is the most agile and extensible ecommerce platform available. Specifically designed for enterprise B2B ecommerce, its enterprise clients around the world include: Volvo, Bosch, Heineken, Vivint Smart Home and Rainbow Sandals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Pros&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>If you&#39;re in the B2B space, this ecommerce solution is specifically designed for your business. Virto Commerce&#39;s .NET open source platform offers no limits to customization, and future proofs your business as the platform grows and changes as your business needs change.</li>\n\t<li>The architecture is easy to work with and configure and it is easily scalable. As an Azure .Net open source platform, you have full control over the code and development of your site.</li>\n\t<li>Virto Commerce has tools to help new store owners, including documentation, samples, forums, tech-support and an enterprise edition to help B2B sellers.</li>\n\t<li>Their leadership team has decades of B2B and enterprise ecommerce experience that they can leverage to help your store succeed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Cons&nbsp;</strong><br />\nAs it is not as well known as some of the larger players in the industry like Shopify and Magento, the Virto ecosystem can seem rather small by comparison.&nbsp;<br />\nAlthough you can get a store up and running quickly if you know how, without any technical knowledge, it is not going to be plug-and-play like some off the shelf solutions would be. You would need some technical background or a dedicated team to set it up and run Virto Commerce. However, Virto does have a comprehensive training and support system for customers and a team of global partners that can guide your implementation process.</p>\n\n<h3><u>BigCommerce</u></h3>\n\n<p>Headquartered in San Francisco and Austin in the United States and Sydney in Australia, this all in one ecommerce platform is used by major brands around the world and offers some unique features.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Pros&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>It&#39;s an all in one ecommerce solution, which includes hosting, themes and apps, that is easy to use for people who don&#39;t have a lot of technical experience.</li>\n\t<li>Pricing is competitive when compared to other platforms, and does not include any transaction fees regardless of the payment gateway used. Plans come with unlimited products, file storage and staff accounts.</li>\n\t<li>Users can sell in places other than their store with easy integration with other platforms like eBay and Amazon, and also social media platforms.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Cons&nbsp;</strong><br />\nThe biggest con with BigCommerce is its complex pricing options that seem to punish stores the more successful they are. Each pricing option has a limit as to how much annual revenue is allowed with that option. If you go over the allotted revenue amount, you will automatically be bumped up to the next pricing level, so stores with over $125,000 in annual revenue should look at platforms designed for enterprise. Additionally, the theme editor can be a bit clunky to use until you get the hang of it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><u>Episerver</u></h3>\n\n<p>An intuitive ecommerce platform, Episerver has a great personalization engine and an easy-to-use content management platform.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Pros&nbsp;</strong><br />\nAs mentioned above, Episerver has fantastic personalization capabilities and its content management is a dream to use. In addition to that, its account management is simple to get the hang of. It also integrates with other tools quite well, particularly with other Episerve SaaS tools like AI. On top of all that, it is generally a fast platform.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Cons&nbsp;</strong><br />\nWhile it boasts great personalization, the commerce engine is a bit lacking with Episerver and it is not particularly user-friendly. Its promotion engine is also a bit complicated. The platform&#39;s developer documentation could also use an upgrade.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3><u>Magento</u></h3>\n\n<p>Magento is a well known name in the ecommerce sphere and a favorite among developers. Many&nbsp;great B2B ecommerce stores have&nbsp;been built with Magento.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Pros&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Probably its most well known feature is its flexibility. Being open source, that means anyone using it can go into the source code and tinker with it for complete customization. It also allows for easy third party integration.</li>\n\t<li>Its large user community means you can find support for issues you have quite easily online, plus they are always developing useful plugins for it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Cons&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>By far the biggest con of Magento is its price. While the community version of it is free and can be used for small businesses, mid-tier businesses and larger enterprises have to shell out upwards of $20,000 per year according to some sources.</li>\n\t<li>While the platform does have a huge user base and a lot of people who like to tinker with it, true Magento developers -- meaning ones who completely know what they are doing -- are hard to find and are likely going to be expensive.</li>\n\t<li>Magento is going to be daunting for people who are not at least a little tech savvy, so if you don&#39;t have a dedicated IT team, this may not be the best platform to use. The loading times for the free version can be slow and hosting can be an issue (although Magento does offer cloud hosting).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
