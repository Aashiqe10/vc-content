With alternative solutions to Magento you can add more functionality to your website, while still keeping the price down. Yes, Magento is the most popular open source ecommerce platform, but that&#39;s due to the fact that when they started, there weren&#39;t many alternatives to Magento. If you don&#39;t want to be stuck in an endless loophole of expensive developing costs, poor website performance, unlimited bug fixes and configurations, you might want to consider switching platforms. Don&#39;t listen to advertisements about how easy it is to scale. Website owners have realized that Magento is a terrible bang for the buck and for the past few years, many companies have left Magento for non-monolithic ecommerce platforms.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe main issue is that Magento&#39;s heavy architecture structure requires you to have knowledge of computer engineering and structural design in order to set it up and get running. For startups this may not be a valuable investment, considering how expensive it is to hire a Magento developer that has knowledge of Java and PHP Zend Frameworks. Additonally, while having a variety applications and extensions is great, it comes at a price in terms of your website performance and overall development costs. With other platforms you get robust features embedded into the platform, omitting the need to spend more and lose performance.&nbsp;</p>\n",

        "content": "<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">There are a myriad of alternative B2B ecommerce platforms. We will look at the positives and negatives of top Magento competitors that you may consider:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Shopify</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>is an excellent platform for those who want to get started quickly. It balances the convenience and control over the process of setting up your first product&#39;s website. You get instant access to simple web tools that allow you to build quickly. This is a closed source platform that is a perfect solution for small-business owners. The easy-to-use features of drag and drop development will ensure that a person with no IT experience can set up a store. However, despite its enormous amount of applications, plug-ins, extensions and fantastic customer support base, Shopify&#39;s functionality is limited. You don&#39;t have options regarding customizability, giving you much less control over your site than open source platforms provide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Volusion</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Another popular Magento alternative is a hosted shopping cart service named Volusion. In contrary to Shopify, Volusion is dedicated to users who are much more concerned about the operational side of the website, than the visual. At the same time, it offers you great expandability options with plug-ins and extensions that also include a variety of design templates to choose from. Volusion is a closed source platform that provides a vast knowledge base and kind personnel that will help you in creating your website at any given point of time. Despite having these excellent features as well as a broad range of marketing tools, Volusion has many cons of its own. The major one, is of course, the price tag. Volusion charges a lot of add-on fees which can be frustrating for small-business owners to pay. Also, Volusion&#39;s template options are very limited, and you have to pay even more for professionally designed ones.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>BigCommerce</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This hosted shopping cart platform is one of the biggest Magento competitors. The only reason why BigCommerce is falling behind Magento&nbsp;on popularity is its limited set of features and design templates. One major benefit of using BigCommerce is an extensive set of how-tos and guidelines that help you in the process of developing your store&#39;s web page. The tutorials were developed by the experts in the field and consist of self-explanatory videos that will quickly help you get your feet wet in the field of electronic commerce and allow for a smooth transition from sophisticated Magento to a much more easy-to-use BigCommerce. Just like the other shopping carts presented in the list, BigCommerce is a closed source (proprietary) solution that offers high security and hassle-free setup, while at the same time, comes with quite a hefty price tag for a starting business owner.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Virto Commerce</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Virto Commerce is a unique open source platform that allows you to quickly set up your website and start selling products or services in no time. It is based on a .NET 4.6 framework and uses cutting-edge web technologies like AngularJS, Liquid and many others. Just like Magento, it markets itself as both a small-business and an enterprise-level ecommerce solution. The platform allows you to launch your website via Microsoft&#39;s cloud and scale it up in no time using Virto Commerce&#39;s multichannel solutions. The company has been long-time valued for its creative problem-solving approaches, flexible pricing models, ecommerce integrations and interchanges as well as great partner selection and website delivery. By using Virto Commerce as an alternative to Magento, you can enjoy its open source and agile features. With agile features, you can scale your market outreach with a single click without hiring an entire team of IT professionals. Take advantage of Virto Commerce&#39;s practices and start selling beyond your business hours as we consider this platform to be the most suitable for large and small businesses alike.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAdditionally, with flexible pricing options - Virto Commerce is far more affordable than Magento. In the long term, Virto Commerce has a much lower total cost of ownership due to the scalability of it&#39;s architecture.​​​​​​​</p>\n",
