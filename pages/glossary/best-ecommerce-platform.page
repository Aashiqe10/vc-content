        "content": "<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">There are a myriad of B2B top ecommerce platforms. We will look at the positives and negatives of the best ecommerce platforms.</h3>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<h3>Shopify</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://virtocommerce.com/glossary/shopify-alternatives\">Shopify</a>&nbsp;is an excellent platform for those who want to get started quickly. It balances the convenience and control over the process of setting up your first product&#39;s website. You get instant access to simple web tools that allow you to build quickly. This is a closed source platform that is a perfect solution for small-business owners. The easy-to-use features of drag and drop development will ensure that a person with no IT experience can set up a store. However, despite its enormous amount of applications, plug-ins, extensions and fantastic customer support base, Shopify&#39;s functionality is limited. You don&#39;t have options regarding customizability, giving you much less control over your site than open source platforms provide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<h3>Volusion</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Another popular platform is a hosted shopping cart service named Volusion. In contrast to Shopify, Volusion is dedicated to users who are much more concerned about the operational side of the website, than the visual. At the same time, it offers you great expandability options with plug-ins and extensions that also include a variety of design templates to choose from. Volusion is a closed source platform that provides a vast knowledge base and kind personnel that will help you in creating your website at any given point of time. Despite having these excellent features as well as a broad range of marketing tools, Volusion has many cons of its own. The major one, is of course, the price tag. Volusion charges a lot of add-on fees which can be frustrating for small-business owners to pay. Also, Volusion&#39;s template options are very limited, and you have to pay even more for professionally designed ones.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<h3>BigCommerce</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This hosted shopping cart platform is quite popular in 2019. The only reason why BigCommerce is falling behind Shopify on popularity is its limited set of features and design templates. One major benefit of using BigCommerce is an extensive set of how-tos and guidelines that help you in the process of developing your store&#39;s web page. The tutorials were developed by the experts in the field and consist of self-explanatory videos that will quickly help you get your feet wet in the field of electronic commerce and allow for a smooth transition from sophisticated Magento to a much more easy-to-use BigCommerce. Just like the other shopping carts presented in the list, BigCommerce is a closed source (proprietary) solution that offers high security and hassle-free setup, while at the same time, comes with quite a hefty price tag for a starting business owner.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<h3>Virto Commerce</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Virto Commerce is a unique open source platform that allows you to quickly set up your website and start selling products or services in no time. One of the best ecommerce platforms,&nbsp;It is based on a .NET 4.6 framework and uses cutting-edge web technologies like AngularJS, Liquid and many others. Just like Magento, Shopify and BigCommerce, it markets itself as both a small-business and an enterprise-level ecommerce solution. The platform allows you to launch your website via Microsoft&#39;s cloud and scale it up in no time using Virto Commerce&#39;s multichannel solutions. The company has been long-time valued for its creative problem-solving approaches, flexible pricing models, ecommerce integrations and interchanges as well as great partner selection and website delivery. With agile features, you can scale your market outreach with a single click without hiring an entire team of IT professionals. Take advantage of Virto Commerce&#39;s practices and start selling beyond your business hours as we consider this platform to be the most suitable for large and small businesses alike.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nAdditionally, with flexible pricing options - Virto Commerce is far more affordable than its competitors. In the long term, Virto Commerce has a low total cost of ownership due to the scalability of it&#39;s architecture.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t<h3>Magento</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://virtocommerce.com/glossary/magento-alternatives\">Magento</a>&nbsp;continues to be an enterprise-level player in the field of the best ecommerce platforms, offering a wide range of business solutions to its customers. It is elastic and provides excellent support to large corporations, while not forgetting about small businesses either. Given its open-source features and the fact that it is very scalable, Magento has become very popular within the community. However, it requires a lot of research and programming knowledge in order to use it, which puts it at a certain disadvantage among the top ecommerce platforms.</p>\n",
