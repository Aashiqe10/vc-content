Business to Business to Consumer (B2B2C) , or more recently called B2X, is the term used to describe the ecommerce model wherein Business &quot;A&quot; and Business &quot;B&quot; engage in a collaborative business development exercise whereby Business &quot;A&quot; pays Business &quot;B&quot; for the ability to offer Business &quot;A&#39;s&quot; product or service to Business &quot;B&#39;s&quot; consumer customer channel. Companies stand to benefit from going directly to customers in business-to-consumer (B2C) and/or direct-to-consumer scenarios instead of going through the supply chain. Cutting out the middleman saves costs for distributors and manufacturers, and those better margins have a trickle-down benefit for their end-users.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nFor new businesses on the market, the B2B2C ecommerce model can serve as a way of quickly becoming a distributor not only in their markets but also to expand their digital influence to other marketplaces. B2B2C ecommerce allows two businesses to combine their forces and start promoting mutually beneficial products, solutions, and services.</h3>\n",
