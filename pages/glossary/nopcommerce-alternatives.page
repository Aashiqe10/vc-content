Here is another thing to consider - open-source platforms are almost entirely free to any businesses, but, they lack security. On the other hand, closed-source solutions can get pricey, but they deliver top-notch security protocols to you.\n\n\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Plugins and Addons.&nbsp;</strong>Always look for a solution that can be expanded by the plugins and add-ons easily. The platform should uncover your store&rsquo;s true potential and add value to your products.\n\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li><strong>Technological literacy.&nbsp;</strong>If you are going to hire a professional web-developer to do this, you don&rsquo;t have to worry about choosing an open source solution. If not, pick a sophisticated platform that for a good price will allow you to build your website without breaking a sweat.\n\t<p>Here are some of the most known NopCommerce competitors:</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n",
