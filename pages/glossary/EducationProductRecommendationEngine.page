        "content": "<p>A product recommendation engine,&nbsp;can be explained in simple terms. You have products to sell and want&nbsp;customers to find those products. Websites have limited space, and&nbsp;search functions often miss the context of what buyers are&nbsp;actually looking for. For example, our Azure-based personalized recommendation engine offers specific&nbsp;products to each customer at different times. As a result, you get higher conversion rates on every session and buyers find what they want - right at the time they are ready to purchase.</p>\n\n<p>Today&#39;s customers&nbsp;expect vendors to know what they might want to buy. If a retailer can take advantage of ecommerce recommendations to tell &nbsp;buyers what they might want to purchase &ndash; not only do sales improve, but the overall customer experience is better. The downside is as a vendor you need to be aware that if your recommender systems do not correctly predict the customer&#39;s next potential purchase, they might think twice about coming back to your store in the future.</p>\n\n<p>A good ecommerce personalization algorithm will&nbsp;not let that happen. It&#39;s set to recommend a range of products from various categories the buyer browsed or has shown interest in before. The goal is to put products in front of the customers that they would be most likely to click&nbsp;and ultimately purchase. A personalized recommendation engine has one main objective, to increase average order value. Typical &#39;Frequently bought together&#39; recommendation mechanisms are meant to up-sell and cross-sell&nbsp;by suggesting additional or similar products based on the items&nbsp;clicked on or added to the basket.</p>\n\n<p>Another popular way to utilize product recommendations is by introducing &quot;Related items&quot;. This displays similar products in different brands, colors, etc., to products a customer has looked at before. Similar to &quot;Frequently bought together&quot;, recommendation engines show products that have been bought together by other shoppers, aiming to increase average order value.</p>\n",

        "content": "<p class=\"section__descr--medium\"><strong>Personalize&nbsp;customer experience via recommendations algorithm</strong></p>\n\n<p>The biggest reason to invest in a product recommendation engine is that with it you can create a personalized experience for each visitor of your online store. This means that aside from having the most popular products in your inventory showcased to potential customers, someone who has been purchasing from your store for a while will also see personalized recommendations related to their prior searches and purchases, as well as their general taste, interests, and style preferences. Our Azure-based self-learning ecommerce personalization module uses several algorithms that track various customer behaviors and build a unique experience for every customer. So, you don&#39;t have to tag related products anymore or use additional widgets and apps to suggest related products.</p>\n\n<p class=\"section__descr--medium\"><strong>Identify best-sellers using personalized product recommendations</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"section__descr--medium\">Certain brands and products always tend to resonate better with more customers than others. Recommender systems in ecommerce can show you which products in your store are most popular with your customers. This can help you plan your inventory better and use the knowledge in your marketing strategy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Follow Customer Journeys</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"section__descr--medium\">Recommendations can help you get a better understanding of your customer journeys. Our product recommendation engine will show you how they browse the store, what they like, what they choose, and when most conversions happen. It can also suggest information you might not have even considered looking at, like the time when most of the transactions occur. Mapping the customer journey can also give you insights on where your conversion process gets stuck, and how to fix it, increasing revenue. Built using Azure Machine Learning, the recommendations engine uses customer data (past customer activity you&#39;ve uploaded, or data collected directly from your digital store) to recommend items for your buyers. It is a powerful tool that uses gathered data and machine-learning to identify the most relevant product recommendations for each customer interaction.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Frequently Bought Together</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"section__descr--medium\">The product recommendation engine automatically identifies and recommends items from your inventory on your product page that are likely to be consumed together in the same transaction. This feature is essentially an algorithm that enables a vendor to predict which items are likely to be bought together based on previous journeys of other customers. Using product recommendations can help a retailer make business decisions in retail environments. Once you know this, you can use it to your advantage in several ways. Ecommerce recommendations analysis would help a vendor improve sales and make calculated business decisions for customers who are in a rush, as well as those shopping leisurely.</p>\n\n<p class=\"section__descr--medium\"><strong>Improve Discoverability</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"section__descr--medium\">If a customer has looked at a product even once, it means they were at least slightly interested, and ecommerce personalization engines take note of their browsing. They will often remind the customers of their browsing history in case they decide to go back and purchase something they have previously viewed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"section__descr--medium\"><strong>Personalized Recommendations</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"section__descr--medium\">Uses the purchase history of each specific customer to recommend products unique to that customer. For example, after a customer purchased a phone from the store, they are taken to the order processing pages, where underneath their current order they would get recommended a variety of different cases for the exact phone they have purchased, aiming to encourage a second purchase.</p>\n",
