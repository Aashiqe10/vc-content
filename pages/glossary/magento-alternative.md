        <p>Magento can be easily named among the top most popular ecommerce platforms in the world. It is the moving force of innovation in its market segment, providing for its customers three distinct platforms: Magento Community Edition, Magento Enterprise Edition, and Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition. This platform easily attracts businesses of all sizes and areas, and there are many reasons why it does. While Magento markets itself as a perfect solution for any of your business’ ecommerce goals, which it certainly is, it can be very frustrating to manage for a new user without any coding or web developing experience. The advantages of using Magento include the opportunity to create a fully customizable web store, if your coding knowledge and expertise give you the ability to use its robust open source framework. Moreover, the paid extensions and enterprise solutions that Magento offers are second to none. Also, Magento takes great pride in providing their clients with the best possible customer support on the market, and this has helped it attract more than 600 big enterprise customers. However, if you are a small business owner who is currently in search of a much simpler solution or you do not have an experience in Magento’s coding base and you do not want to hire an IT manager, you might want to check out some of the best options that are currently available in the market of shopping-cart software.</p>
        <p>If you have decided to switch from using Magento, here is what you should consider while choosing your Magento alternative.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong> Open Source or Closed Source.</strong> Open source software like Linux or Mozilla Web Browser and closed source or so-called proprietary software, like Microsoft Windows or Adobe products, have been around for a long time. Open source platforms offer the high level of customizability while at the same time being almost entirely free. However, there are certain things that they lack that closed source platforms have. For example, security and customer support. If it is in your blood to have full control over your website, share the extensions and plug-ins of the platform with the community, then open source platforms will be the way to go for you.</p>
            <li><strong> Price Tag.</strong> Proprietary (closed source) platforms come with a price tag that can add up to hundreds of US dollars. At the same time, open source Magento competitors offer basic features for free. However, if you would like to get an enterprise package or develop your website’s functionality with extensions, you may run into some unpleasant fees.</p>
            <li><strong> Special Features.</strong> Always try to look for Magento competitors that have lots of extensions and plugins to work with. The right platform for you is the one that will help you uncover your website's potential and broaden its functionality for the great value. </p>
            <li><strong> Your technological literacy.</strong> Are you going to have a professional web-developer on staff that will help you with setting up your website on a hosted shopping cart platform? If not, you might be left with an option of a much more expensive, yet more sophisticated closed source platform. If you do possess some coding knowledge and looking at the lines of code does not make you nervous,  open-source shopping carts will offer the most freedom for the lowest price.</p>
            <li><strong> SAAS or Self-hosted?</strong> If you are a large business with an established hardware infrastructure, you will be likely to have the website hosted on your own.. On the other hand, if you are less hardware-heavy, SaaS platforms that will have your website hosted for you for a certain price would make a lot more sense!</p>
        </ol>
        <p>With these points in mind let’s look at the following alternatives to Magento!</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Shopify</h2>
    <div class="col-w">
        <div class="col __col-30">
            <img alt="Magento Alternative - Shopify" src="assets/images/shopify1.jpg" />
        </div>
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            Shopify is an excellent platform for those who want to get started quickly in the diverse field of ecommerce. It is a perfect platform that balances the convenience and control over the process of setting up your first product’s website. What you get is instant access to easy to handle web tools that allow you to build your site in a single click. This is a closed source platform (or so-called proprietary platform) that is a perfect solution for  small-business owners who don’t want to handle a lot by themselves and prefer  all of the developing processes to be taken care of. The great 24/7 customer support will be happy to guide you through the challenging process of a web shop creation. An easy-to-use feature of drag and drop development will ensure that a person with no IT experience will be able to do it. However, despite its enormous amount of applications, plug-ins, extensions and fantastic customer support base, Shopify’s functionality is limited to the platform. You don’t have any options regarding expanding your website’s customizability, giving you much less control over your site than open source Magento competitors can provide.

    <h2>Volusion</h2>
    <div class="col-w">
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-right: 20px;">
            Another popular Magento alternative is a hosted shopping cart service named Volusion. In contrary to Shopify, Volusion is dedicated to those users who are much more concerned about the operational side of the website, than the marketing or visual one. At the same time, it offers you great expandability options with plug-ins and extensions that also include a variety of design templates to choose from. The Volusion is a closed source platform that provides a vast knowledge base and kind personnel that will help you in creating your website at any given point of time. The Volusion team can be highly credited for putting high effort into providing their clients with the best possible experience. Despite having these excellent features as well as a broad range of marketing tools, Volusion has many cons of its own. The major one, just like of Shopify’s is, of course, the price tag. Volusion charges a lot of add-on fees which can be frustrating for small-business owners to pay. Also, Volusion’s template options are very limited, and you have to pay even more for professionally designed ones.

            <img alt="Magento Alternative - Volusion" src="assets/images/volusion1.jpg" />
        </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Bigcommerce</h2>
    <div class="col-w">
        <div class="col __col-30">
            <img alt="Magento Alternative - Bigcommerce" src="assets/images/bigcommerce.jpg" />
        </div>
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            This hosted shopping cart platform is one of the biggest Magento competitors, as well as the direct alternative to Shopify and Volusion. The only reason why Bigcommerce is falling behind Shopify on popularity is its limited set of features and design templates. One major benefit of using Bigcommerce is an extensive set of how-tos and guidelines that help you in the process of developing your store’s webpage. The tutorials were developed by the experts in the field and consist of self-explanatory videos that will quickly help you get your feet wet in the field of electronic commerce and allow for a smooth transition from sophisticated Magento to a much more easy-to-use Bigcommerce. Just like the other shopping carts presented in the list, Bigcommerce is a closed source (proprietary) solution that offers high security and hassle-free setup, while at the same time, comes with quite a hefty price tag for a starting business owner.

    <h2>Virto Commerce</h2>
    <div class="col-w">
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-right: 20px;">
            Virto Commerce is a unique open source platform that allows you to quickly set up your website and start selling products or services in no time.
