        <p>Magento can be easily named among the top most popular ecommerce platforms in the world. It is the moving force of innovation in its market segment, providing for its customers three distinct platforms: Magento Community Edition, Magento Enterprise Edition, and Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition. This platform easily attracts businesses of all sizes and areas, and there are many reasons why it does. While Magento markets itself as a perfect solution for any of your business’ ecommerce goals, which it certainly is, it can be very frustrating to manage for a new user without any coding or web developing experience. The advantages of using Magento include the opportunity to create a fully customizable web store, if your coding knowledge and expertise give you the ability to use its robust open source framework. Moreover, the paid extensions and enterprise solutions that Magento offers are second to none. Also, Magento takes great pride in providing their clients with the best possible customer support on the market, and this has helped it attract more than 600 big enterprise customers. However, if you are a small business owner who is currently in search of a much simpler solution or you do not have an experience in Magento’s coding base and you do not want to hire an IT manager, you might want to check out some of the best options that are currently available in the market of shopping-cart software.</p>
        <p>If you have decided to switch from using Magento, here is what you should consider while choosing your Magento alternative.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong> Open Source or Closed Source.</strong> Open source software like Linux or Mozilla Web Browser and closed source or so-called proprietary software, like Microsoft Windows or Adobe products, have been around for a long time. Open source platforms offer the high level of customizability while at the same time being almost entirely free. However, there are certain things that they lack that closed source platforms have. For example, security and customer support. If it is in your blood to have full control over your website, share the extensions and plug-ins of the platform with the community, then open source platforms will be the way to go for you.</p>
            <li><strong> Price Tag.</strong> Proprietary (closed source) platforms come with a price tag that can add up to hundreds of US dollars. At the same time, open source Magento competitors offer basic features for free. However, if you would like to get an enterprise package or develop your website’s functionality with extensions, you may run into some unpleasant fees.</p>
            <li><strong> Special Features.</strong> Always try to look for Magento competitors that have lots of extensions and plugins to work with. The right platform for you is the one that will help you uncover your website's potential and broaden its functionality for the great value. </p>
            <li><strong> Your technological literacy.</strong> Are you going to have a professional web-developer on staff that will help you with setting up your website on a hosted shopping cart platform? If not, you might be left with an option of a much more expensive, yet more sophisticated closed source platform. If you do possess some coding knowledge and looking at the lines of code does not make you nervous,  open-source shopping carts will offer the most freedom for the lowest price.</p>
            <li><strong> SAAS or Self-hosted?</strong> If you are a large business with an established hardware infrastructure, you will be likely to have the website hosted on your own.. On the other hand, if you are less hardware-heavy, SaaS platforms that will have your website hosted for you for a certain price would make a lot more sense!</p>
        </ol>
        <p>With these points in mind let’s look at the following alternatives to Magento!</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Shopify</h2>
    <div class="col-w">
        <div class="col __col-30">
            <img alt="Magento Alternative - Shopify" src="assets/images/shopify1.jpg" />
        </div>
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            Shopify is an excellent platform for those who want to get started quickly in the diverse field of ecommerce. It is a perfect platform that balances the convenience and control over the process of setting up your first product’s website. What you get is instant access to easy to handle web tools that allow you to build your site in a single click. This is a closed source platform (or so-called proprietary platform) that is a perfect solution for  small-business owners who don’t want to handle a lot by themselves and prefer  all of the developing processes to be taken care of. The great 24/7 customer support will be happy to guide you through the challenging process of a web shop creation. An easy-to-use feature of drag and drop development will ensure that a person with no IT experience will be able to do it. However, despite its enormous amount of applications, plug-ins, extensions and fantastic customer support base, Shopify’s functionality is limited to the platform. You don’t have any options regarding expanding your website’s customizability, giving you much less control over your site than open source Magento competitors can provide.
        </div>

    <h2>Volusion</h2>
    <div class="col-w">
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-right: 20px;">
            Another popular Magento alternative is a hosted shopping cart service named Volusion. In contrary to Shopify, Volusion is dedicated to those users who are much more concerned about the operational side of the website, than the marketing or visual one. At the same time, it offers you great expandability options with plug-ins and extensions that also include a variety of design templates to choose from. The Volusion is a closed source platform that provides a vast knowledge base and kind personnel that will help you in creating your website at any given point of time. The Volusion team can be highly credited for putting high effort into providing their clients with the best possible experience. Despite having these excellent features as well as a broad range of marketing tools, Volusion has many cons of its own. The major one, just like of Shopify’s is, of course, the price tag. Volusion charges a lot of add-on fees which can be frustrating for small-business owners to pay. Also, Volusion’s template options are very limited, and you have to pay even more for professionally designed ones.

        <div class="col __col-30">
            <img alt="Magento Alternative - Volusion" src="assets/images/volusion1.jpg" />
        </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Bigcommerce</h2>
    <div class="col-w">
        <div class="col __col-30">
            <img alt="Magento Alternative - Bigcommerce" src="assets/images/bigcommerce.jpg" />
        </div>
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            This hosted shopping cart platform is one of the biggest Magento competitors, as well as the direct alternative to Shopify and Volusion. The only reason why Bigcommerce is falling behind Shopify on popularity is its limited set of features and design templates. One major benefit of using Bigcommerce is an extensive set of how-tos and guidelines that help you in the process of developing your store’s webpage. The tutorials were developed by the experts in the field and consist of self-explanatory videos that will quickly help you get your feet wet in the field of electronic commerce and allow for a smooth transition from sophisticated Magento to a much more easy-to-use Bigcommerce. Just like the other shopping carts presented in the list, Bigcommerce is a closed source (proprietary) solution that offers high security and hassle-free setup, while at the same time, comes with quite a hefty price tag for a starting business owner.

    <h2>Virto Commerce</h2>
    <div class="col-w">
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-right: 20px;">
            Virto Commerce is a unique open source platform that allows you to quickly set up your website and start selling products or services in no time.

        <h2>Wordpress + WooCommerce</h2>
    <div class="col-w">
        <div class="col __col-30">
            <img alt="Magento Alternative - Wordpress + WooCommerce" src="assets/images/wordpress.jpg" />
        </div>
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            Wordpress is one of the biggest players in the website building market. When paired with Woocommerce it becomes one of the major Magento alternatives in the field of e-commerce. It differs from Shopify and Bigcommerce in that it is an open-source solution and if you possess enough programming knowledge, you can turn your shop into powerful selling platform that can be hosted anywhere. If you are a fan of installing lots of plugins to improve the work of your website, then this platform is made just for you. The plugins extend your options regarding functionality and allow smoothing of the process of tax reports while also increasing the conversion rates by unique design features. Woocommerce is pretty big: almost 1/3 of online stores are built using this platform. It is valued across users for its clear product presentation, with zoomed pictures, gallery pictures, and photos.

        <h2>Squarespace</h2>
    <div class="col-w">
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-right: 20px;">
            A multi-tool in e-commerce field and a major alternative to Magento. It is highly recommended for people who know nothing about programming or design but still want to have a great-looking website. It is easy to set up and manage, however, compared to other platforms it lacks some essential features that Shopify or Bigcommerce possess. The thing that staff of Squarespace knows for sure is how to present their product, as their home page is truly a masterpiece. You may even think about the advanced features the service may provide, and it does so for sure. Take into consideration its significant advantages that include: Cover Page Builder, live content editing, inline editing. Great-looking templates will ensure that your clients will receive the top-notch user experience as well as make your product look much more sophisticated. With Squarespace, get into SEO by receiving custom page titles, URLs, description titles, and redirects in addition to blogging capabilities that allow you to host your podcast, just like using Wordpress.

            <h2>Wix</h2>
    <div class="col-w">
        <div class="col __col-30">
            <img alt="Magento Alternative - Wix" src="assets/images/wix.jpg" />
        </div>
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            Just like Wordpress, Wix delivers an incredible website builder that can be used for free. In the past years, they have been promoting themselves as an e-commerce platform, thus, becoming another big alternative to Magento in the field. It is especially useful for small businesses and for those who will be creating websites in the following niches: design, photography, restaurant business and music due to the abundance of specific tools that may boost your website. Wix poses itself as the most innovative website builder amongst the existing competitors. Easy to access dashboards and drag & drop solutions allow you to quickly send invoices, accept any orders or let the client place the bookings. The design can be suitably chosen exactly for YOUR needs by selecting from multiple themes and templates. To further it more, the company has recently introduced Artificial Design Intelligence that can have your website created for you based on your preferences. The platform keeps expanding and with years, they will introduce new features that will suit your business.

            <h2>3Dcart</h2>
    <div class="col-w">
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-right: 20px;">
            This platform besides other Magento alternatives is being widely used, and therefore, should never be looked down. It may serve you as a perfect solution, especially if you are planning to set up a hosted e-commerce shop. The platform is highly customizable, giving you the needed flexibility in the process of setting up your online shop. 3Dcart has been in the field since 1997 and has proven their reliability. Since then, they have been keeping up with the latest cutting-edge technologies and design trends, always updating their templates and themes. Still, if you compare it to other shopping carts like Shopify and Bigcommerce, you will be able to use great reporting tools with exciting built-in features such as gift certificates, live chat plugins and bundling options. The only significant disadvantage that users have noticed while using Magento is it's difficult to use interface and the complexity of adding a new product to a store.
