    <p class="text">
    Elasticpath offers a great ecommerce solution for the businesses that offer digital services online. Thanks to the Coretex API technology, the platform delivers consistent transactional data, which can be displayed in real-time to every single one of your customer channels. </p>
    <p class="text">
    The platform also offers advanced features like personalized merchandising, product information management and native website builder that come right out of the box. </p>
    <p class="text">
    Another important factor to consider is that Elastic Path is an open-source platform, which can bring you advanced features and enable a better customer experience. This particular solution is very clean and does not require an installation of enormous amounts of plugins. </p>
    <p class="text">
    Despite this platform being a Java based ecommerce solution, it will be easy for any other experienced programmers to figure out. Its rich SEO features and flexible framework have prompted companies like Garmin, Western Union, TimeInc and Kiabi to pick this particular platform over the others. </p>
    <p class="text">
    Despite the enormous range of features provided by the platform, its open source code can also be a downside for some users. The majority of business owners are not that tech savvy, so they might have a hard time working with this platform. Its lack of blogging software that is becoming more and more common across all solutions can also be a challenge. If this is a critical feature for your business, you might have to install another platform for content management, thus reducing the response speed of the website. </p>
    <p class="text">
    If these issues look like they might be deal breakers for you, here are some of the most popular Elastic Path alternatives. </p>
    <h2>Demandware</h2>
    <div class="col-w">
        <div class="col __col-30">
            <img alt="ElasticPath Alternatives - Demandware" src="assets/images/demandware.jpg" />
        </div>
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
            <a href="http://www.demandware.com/" rel="nofollow">Demandware</a> offers the features of channel management and content management that Elasticpath lacks. This Elasticpath alternative is also a SaaS platform, meaning you wouldn’t have to worry about maintaining its infrastructure. 
            With Demandware’s vast template library you can easily build an eye-catching website and implement the best UX practices within it. With total control over the process of creating your web store that Demandware provides, there is no need to worry about technical aspects of the platform, like database management and networks. 
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
        The only bad thing about this particular alternative to Elasticpath is its human resource requirements, meaning you might need to hire a professional programmer. However, you are looking for an enterprise solution and have the development power and resources to manage Demandware’s top features and practices, then you should definitely look into this ecommerce platform. </p>
    <h2>Ecwid</h2>
    <div class="col-w">
        <div class="col __col-70 text" style="margin-top: 0; padding-right: 20px;">
           With this platform you can embed a personal web store into an already existing page, so you won’t need to go through the entire sophisticated process of setting it up yourself. The web store requires almost no technical experience, as the <a href="https://www.ecwid.com/" rel="nofollow">Ecwid's</a> builder is pretty intuitive. It also gives you the maximum amount of tools possible without limiting your creativity. 
           </div>

        As a result you will get a full-fledged web store with all the important features you would want to see in one. Worried about how it is going to look? Worry no more, as you will have a tremendous amount of templates available to you, specifically designed to fit your web store’s needs. Feel free to add product listings, manage your products and add images. See the reviews posted by your customers and enable the social media marketing feature to bring your product to more and more potential clients. </p>
        <p class="text">
