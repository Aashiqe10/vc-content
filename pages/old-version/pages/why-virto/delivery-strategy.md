                    Virto Commerce has a defined process that we use to deliver our integrations. We have developed this process from years of experience deploying ecommerce
                    platforms around the world.  As we specialize in customized ecommerce platforms for enterprises and B2B companies, every implementation will be differ to
                    some extent, but all will follow the process defined below.  Our process has been refined over the years and it ensures we can deliver your platform on
                    time and within budget.

                    Here is a brief outline of our tried and tested Virto Commerce delivery strategy:
                </p>
                <p class="section__descr">
                    <strong>Phase 1:</strong> Before signing a contract, Virto Commerce’s team will analyze your RFP to ensure our platform’s functionality covers your business
                    requirements and is a good fit for your needs.  Assuming we are a good fit, we will then give you estimations of 1) expected budget for implementation and 2)
                    an implementation timeline.
                </p>
                <p class="section__descr">
                    We can also deliver a proof of concept to ensure fit. The proof of concept would be a quickly done implementation to ensure critical requirements can be delivered
                    without high risk.
                </p>
                <p class="section__descr">
                    Additionally, during phase one, there is an option of an onsite workshop. During the workshop, Virto’s solution architects and business analysts will come to you
                    to clarify requirements with your key stakeholders. This high touch step ensures delivery of accurate project budget and timelines.

                    <strong>Phase 2:</strong> After you sign a contract to move forward, we schedule a kick off workshop and a planning "Sprint Zero".
                </p>
                <p class="section__descr">
                    The goal of this sprint is to prioritize system requirements and identify the scope of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and entire project. The average duration
                    of implementation is from four to eight months, with half of the time being spent on the MVP and the remaining time completing the project.  
                </p>
                <p class="section__descr">
                    For Virto Commerce, the MVP is essential.  Being an agile developer, we know the best way to build the ideal product is to incorporate real feedback from users
                    gained from the MVP.
                </p>
                <p class="section__descr">
                    Our development process consists of two week sprints, each including user stories and traditional SCRUM practices (customer demos, retrospectives) to keep the
                    process as transparent as possible.  In the final two weeks before the MVP is finished, we finetune it (more Kanban).  In the first two weeks after the MVP is
                    live, we focus on system maintenance and improvement to ensure delivery of identified business goals.

                <p class="section__descr">
                    <strong>Why build an MVP?</strong>
                    <u>Using our agile methodology, the MVP gives you the chance to update your requirements based on actual experience of working with system.</u>

                    <strong><u>Phase 3: Implementation Completed.</u></strong> <u>At this point, we suggest our clients join our <strong>customer success management service.</strong>
                    This ensures our platform delivers your expected value for the long term, with performance and quality indicators stable despite changed business environments.
                    It also includes trivial support (bugfixing and RFC implementation) and constant monitoring of system quality indicators to ensure they align with the SLA.

                        <strong>Going global?</strong> Virto Commerce is expert at running simultaneous projects around the globe. We know how to overcome the challenges encountered
                        when working in multiple countries – such as local regulations, practices and technical limitations come into play. In these complex situations, we use the
                        LeSS framework which enables us to run up to eight teams globally without loss in management quality. If a large number of regional projects is needed, we can
                        also build <strong>custom platforms</strong> on top Virto Commerce’s native platform for efficiency, making each implementation cheaper. Our architecture
                        allows <strong>building layers</strong> to take into account your business rules, integrations, UI approach and more. In this instance the native core of our platform is
                        easily maintainable so it can continuously be updated.
