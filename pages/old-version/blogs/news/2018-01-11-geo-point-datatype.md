title: You Can Now Add Geo-Point Datatype Into Product's Properties in Virto Commerce
---
### <dfn>Virto Commerce has recently added a new <a href="{{ 'https://virtocommerce.com/b2b-ecommerce-platform' | absolute_url }}">platform</a> module that will allow its users to add Geo-point datatype into their product properties.</dfn>

A geo-point is a single latitude/longitude point on the Earth’s surface. Geo-points can be used to calculate distance from a point, to determine whether a point falls within a bounding box or in aggregations.

With this new Virto Commerce feature, the following changes and additions are available:

•	Ability to add a new product property as Geo-point;

•	Elastic Search should index it as geo-point;

•	Search service should provide ability to find nearest products by geo-point;

•	Search service should provide ability to order by distance from geo-point.

<i>"We're happy to offer this new service to our users. Finding the closest branches in B2B scenario is now a part of our offered B2B solution. Geolocation options are extremely useful for many types of stores and we hope our customers will find this new feature beneficial."</i> - Alexander Siniouguine, CEO of Virto Commerce.
