                    <strong>Is Your Ecommerce Platform holding your business back?</strong> With a multitude of changes to B2C and B2B2C ecommerce, especially with an increase in
                    promotions that create complex pricing structures, B2C and B2B2C ecommerce has become more sophisticated than it was in the past. B2C and B2B2C companies doing a
                    large volume of commerce online need to consider their ecommerce platform choices carefully – high risks come along with choosing an out of the box platform that
                    fails to grow with your business.
