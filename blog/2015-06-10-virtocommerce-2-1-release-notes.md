#### Shipping methods support

Shipping Methods - they are the carriers and services used to send your products and are also used to evaluate shipping rates and tracking customers' parcels.

We added the ability to define new shipping methods and integrate them into the system. After a new shipping method is installed, you can configure it individually for each store in the system and also specify the display order in the checkout page.

#### Dashboard

Dashboard is updated to use a unified widget management engine. Now any module can register custom widgets to it just like to any other widget container in the Virto Commerce Platform.

Widgets displaying real catalog and marketing data have been added. They act as shortcuts to other blades. Click any widget to navigate to catalogs or promotions respectively. This functionality will be extended more in the next sprint.

#### Toolbar extensibility

Toolbar extension point was added. Now any module can register custom commands to a toolbar on any blade. Furthermore, the toolbar extensibility is not limited to commands only. Anything can be added to “custom content area” on the right blade’s side. This is the place for switches, flags, progress indicators, etc.

In the above toolbar, extensibility sample 2, additional commands and a switch were added to “Content items” blade.

#### Security Role management

Security permissions were grouped to provide more convenient role management. Grouping is done “as needed”, meaning that any module can register permissions to any existing group or create new ones where appropriate. It allows for each module to be customized and assigned specific permissions that then can be utilized by a system administrator.

Grouped permissions in role management UI.

#### Security User API keys management

Added simple API keys to use for integration with other systems, like Zapier, Zendesk etc. User can generate API key and use it for API calls.

API keys management updated to support multiple keys (Hmac, simple). They can be active/disabled, named.

#### Dynamic conditions in pricelist assignments

Placed price for a shopper depends on the pricelist being applied. The pricelist itself is bound to a specific catalog by “pricelist assignment”. We’ve added dynamic conditions for refining when and which pricelist should be assigned.
