I've been repeatedly asked, why did we have the image of Hyperloop on our site. Well, the reason is simple. The page [https://virtocommerce.com/startups](https://virtocommerce.com/startups) where the image is placed is intended for Startups, and the image purpose is to inspire startups to dream big. The Hyperloop is a great example of dreaming big, that's why we decided to put it here.
