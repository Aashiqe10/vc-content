            <p class="text">An online vendor catalog which has been enhanced via an open catalog interface to support PunchOut Procurement associated with a PunchOut website.</p>
            <h2 class="sub-title">How it works?</h2>
            <p class="text"><strong>It is based upon an Open Catalog Interface</strong> (OCI), one of the standard formats used by SAP Supplier Relationship Management, ORDIGES Purchase-to-Pay, Microsoft Dynamics AX and other ERP/Purchasing Systems which connects to external punch-out catalogs.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-title">What is PunchOut Procurement?</h3>
			<p class="text">The interaction between a vendor's web storefront and a buyer's procurement application.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-title">What is a punchout website?</h3>
            <p class="text">An  ecommerce website that permits a buyer to purchase from a supplier's website from within the Buyer's own procurement application. The PunchOut Website has the ability to communicate directly with a buying organization's procurement system through  cXML. cXML allows programs to modify and validate documents without prior knowledge of their form. The Buying organization exit's or "punches out" of their company's system and links to the supplier's web-based catalog to select and add items to their shopping cart. Pertinent information about the transaction is delivered to the appropriate channels during the connection.</p>
            <h3 class="sub-title">What is a Supplier Catalog</h3>
            <p class="text">A seller's itemized listing of products for sale.</p>
            <h2 class="sub-title">Why is it valuable?</h2>
            <p class="text">A PunchOut Website eliminates the Buying organization's need to import supplier catalogs directly into their procurement system thereby saving time and expense.</p>
